AUTHOR'S NOTE

Some consider me a mediocre player. Jimmy Cha and Hun-Hyun Cho often
laugh at my weak moves. Others think I am a brilliant player. For Mr.
Kim, Park's brother, and little Lee, the dream of life is to become
as strong as I am. I am both strong and weak. I am a first kyu.

When I wrote this story in Korea in 1992, my goal was to give people
the opportunity to read a story about the first kyu. When I was
offered to translate this story into English, I did not want to do it
for two main reasons.

Firstly, despite it seeming like a daunting task for someone whose
native language is not English, I wanted no one but myself to
translate the book, fearing that the spirit I put into the original
would be lost in translation. Secondly, I did not believe that
English-speaking readers would be able to appreciate this story
properly due to cultural differences.

Janice Kim, a professional player and publisher, however, convinced
me to take on the job. She insisted that the book, at the very least,
would present Korean culture more naturally than official propaganda.

And here it is before you. I must admit that translating the novel
into English was harder than writing the original in Korean.

I would like to thank Janice and Richard for their efforts that made
this book a reality. I also thank Roy Langston, a good friend and Go
partner, for advice and support throughout the agonizing translation
process.

I even wonder: do the mystical Go gods smile upon me? All my life,
I unconditionally loved this Game and did not expect anything in
return. And yet... My love for this game allowed me to write this
book. Yes, I am sure - they are smiling.

BEFORE WE BEGIN

Allow me to tell you a story. An old story, a very old story.
Do you know how to play Go? Ah, you play at the strength of a first kyu.
Really? Have you ever played in a professional qualifying tournament? No!?
Then you are not a first kyu!

I know, I know... nowadays, all the bad players call themselves first kyus.
However, this story is not about those players. This is the story of a true
first kyu.

Near Niagara Falls, there is a tobacco shop owned by a man named Shin.
On rainy days, he looks at the waterfall and mumbles something like this:
"Should have raised the stakes in the ponnuki...".

Do you know what he's talking about? No? Let me tell you.
Few know this story. Listen.

THE OLD MASTER

On a winter evening, in early 1940th, the leading players of Korea gathered
in the living room of Lord Cho's house to meet with a Japanese professional
player, a master of 9-dan, Kitani Minoru. Despite it being a friendly visit,
the atmosphere in the room was tense due to the competition that existed
between the two countries for centuries. The rivalry filled the air much like
the scent of tobacco would if everyone in the room were constantly smoking.

But after a while, the sense of rivalry turned into embarrassment - even with
a two-stone handicap, none of the Korean players could win a game against the
Japanese professional. However, this was not surprising given the history of
the development of the game in both countries. In Japan, since around the 19th
century, the government supported and encouraged professional players and Go
training schools. In Korea, Go was considered one of the aristocratic games for
leisure, with no efforts made to develop or spread the game beyond privileged
classes. Therefore, it was not surprising that the so-called leading players of
Korea were losing one after another, even with a two-stone handicap, to one of
the best professional players in a country where the game had evolved over
centuries.

At first, the Koreans in the room still believed that at least one player would
manage to win against the Japanese master. But after the four strongest players:
Ro, Yun, Min, and Cha lost their games, no one expressed a desire to play the
next game. When the host of the house, Lord Cho, asked:

"Who would like to play the next game?", there was dead silence.
"Perhaps that's enough for today," thought the host.
"But what to do now? It's still quite early for dinner..." Lord Cho felt awkward.

The pause became unreasonably long, and then a low but decisive voice sounded
from the corner:

"Sir, may I suggest the next game?"

Master Kwon was a well-known player in his younger days after several games with
Master Ro, a leading player of his time. But now, at the age of sixty-five, Kwon
had not played serious games for a while. Today, he was present not as a player
but as a journalist. He wrote a Go column in the daily newspaper and intended to
write an article about the visit of the Japanese professional to Lord Cho's house.
But what could he write about this timid silence?

Yes, it was simply cowardice, a reluctance to play due to fear of defeat. Why not
try, why not attempt, to win against this Japanese player?! Without playing, one
cannot win! In a game like Go, even the impossible is possible if one has enough
dedication and discipline. Master Kwon could not contain his fighting spirit, the
same spirit that helped him win many games in his younger years against tougher
opponents.

Lord Cho cautiously welcomed the bold proposal of the old master. As the host, he,
of course, wanted to salvage the evening, but as a Korean, he felt irritation at
the prospect of another defeat.

Lord Cho held a pause and very gently asked:

"Two stones might be too little. Perhaps, Master Kwon, you would like to play at three stones?"

Desperation echoed in his voice. Surely, he desired victory by any means. But such
a suggestion was extraordinary. Honor and pride were valued above all by these players,
and playing at three stones was a match between a teacher and a student, not a friendly
game between the strongest players of two countries!

But what if Kwon loses even at three stones? He would never be able to call himself a
master again — an unimaginable humiliation! Lord Cho had gone too far this time. But
this was Lord Cho, one of the most influential people in the country. No one dared to
oppose him.

All eyes turned to Kwon. Will he accept this proposal or not?
Closing his eyes, Kwon spoke slowly:

"You all know that playing at three stones does not befit the status of an international
friendly match. However, I cannot reject Lord Cho's proposal, as I am one of the grateful
recipients of his generous support, both material and spiritual... Yes, I will play as
suggested. But I will also show you how inappropriate such a handicap is, winning the
game confidently and convincingly."

The game began. Kwon hardly spent any time contemplating. He made each move almost
immediately after Kitani's stone touched the board. The sixty-five-year-old Kwon was
highly spirited and angry. Angry at having to play with an unreasonably large handicap,
angry at the Koreans who couldn't win even a single game against this Japanese opponent.

On the other hand, Kitani Minoru, 9-dan, played as expected, quite professionally,
carefully considering each move. The game continued for over three hours, with Kwon
using most of that time.

A three-stone handicap gave Kwon a significant advantage. The game was nearing its end,
and Kwon's position was convincingly better. The Japanese master did not give up and
tried to narrow the gap, but no one believed that Kitani would win the game — Kwon's
advantage was too great. Then it happened. Overconfident, Kwon ignored Kitani's ko-threat.

Ko is a Buddhist term, signifying eternity. In Go, it means the sequential taking of one
stone. To avoid repeating the position, a ko-threat must be played elsewhere. Kwon's
incorrect response to the ko-threat led to the death of one of his large groups.

How could the master make such a mistake! No one in the room could believe their eyes.
The game was decided: perhaps unfairly, but definitively. The old master stared at the
lower right corner, where his dead group stood, hoping to find a miraculous move that
would bring the group back to life. But there was no such move.

After a few minutes of silence, Kwon resigned. The formalities — removing stones,
exchanging bows — Kwon performed mechanically and then left Lord Cho's company.
On the doorstep of his home, he collapsed. Anger, disappointment, humiliation,
regret — too many emotions for a sixty-five-year-old man. From that day on, he
remained in bed and never recovered. Three months later, the old master passed away.

FAVORITE

"Why do only girls and bad players keep asking for more after they've been killed once again?", 
muttered Wook. He felt the crumpled wad of money in his pocket that he had won tonight.
It was a play on words, as the slang term for a woman's role in sex and the starting cut
on the Go board was the same. He smiled, satisfied with the memory of Madame Kang, who
became "killed" several times a few nights ago, and the countless "dead" groups of Sir
Stupido during the games last night. She and he demanded the next date as soon as possible.
Yes, a remarkable resemblance between girls and bad players. Wook noted it with surprise.

He pulled out the crumpled money, approximately fifty thousand. Not bad. He stuffed the
money back into his pocket. With this money, he could buy five hundred packs of "Chungja".
Buying cigarettes added confidence and satisfaction. Wook quickly left the motel, caught a
taxi, and, instructing the driver, went to a luxurious sauna. Today he could afford a private
room, consisting of a huge bath and an adjacent bedroom. Hurriedly undressing, he immersed his
body in hot water and understood the Creator's feelings on His seventh day.

He pondered what to do on Sunday. It was only eleven in the morning. Perhaps, he should take
some time to sleep and relax. He earned a break. Then he would take Iku to have some good beer
tonight, not the cheap soy-based liquor sold at every roadside kiosk. And he wouldn't go to
Sir Stupido today.

Wook was a fan of boxing and remembered Liston. How difficult it was for him to step back into
the ring against Clay after the defeat! However, losers deserved suffering.

Someone knocked on the door. It was the masseur — a blind young man in his twenties. Wook was a
little scared, perhaps because the masseur was blind, or perhaps because Wook subconsciously
feared strangers. But, comforted by the familiar surroundings, Wook relaxed on the king-sized
bed and allowed the blind masseur to work on his tired body. The masseur worked professionally,
energetically, yet soothingly. The feeling of fatigue slowly faded, replaced by a sense of bliss.
The noise of an anti-government student protest echoed in the distance. It annoyed him a bit,
but not for long. Wook drifted into a deep and peaceful sleep.

A STONE THROWN INTO A CALM LAKE

Wook Kwon was born in the winter of 1950 during the Korean War, a time when there were rumors
that China was preparing to invade South Korea to assist its ally, North Korea. Wook grew up in
the post-war chaos when the socio-economic atmosphere of the country was extremely unstable.

His father, Mr. Kwon, was a shrewd businessman who could provide for his family. While most
children needed food, shoes, clothes, or just love, Wook's childhood was relatively carefree.

Mr. Kwon was an unwavering authority in the family. Good education and exemplary behavior were
strict requirements imposed on his children. Wook was an exception. His father allowed him to do
things his brothers and sisters could only dream of. Perhaps it was because Wook was the youngest
child born when his father was already forty. Moreover, Wook was a son, not a daughter. Wook had
two brothers and two sisters. Like in baseball with a 2-2 count, Mr. Kwon, like any good pitcher,
wanted the third pitch.

Although Mr. Kwon made some concessions for Wook, he always felt that his father was much stricter
than the fathers of his friends. Apparently, Mr. Kwon expected great success from his youngest son.

In Korea, students who wanted to enter higher education institutions started taking entrance exams
from the sixth grade of middle school. Schools in Korea were classified, although unofficially,
based on the academic abilities of their students. There was a "top school", followed by "one of
the best schools", "good schools", "average schools", "below-average schools", and "bad schools".
This classification influenced future careers, marriages, and social status. Those who graduated
from the best schools and universities were often called "KS people," where "K" and "S" were the
initials of two schools.

The Kwons were known as a "KS family". Mr. Kwon didn't even consider "one of the best schools" for
his children. It had to be only the best school! Fortunately, the children were intelligent and
hardworking — prerequisites for attending the best school. Two sisters and one brother of Wook
were already "KS people." The second brother was a sophomore at "KS University." Wook was in the
first grade of "KS School".

Mr. Kwon had nothing to complain about his children, provoking envy among friends and acquaintances.
His youngest daughter easily passed both school and university exams with top grades. Even the city
newspaper published an article about the "family of geniuses".

Three years later, Wook entered "B" University, and Mr. Kwon's ambitions were satisfied. Wook was also
a good student. Of course, Wook's father would not be disappointed. For the Kwons, Wook's graduation
exams were just a formality. In three years, a record must be set: five out of five children will
become "KS people"!

Imagine yourself on the shore of a calm lake. Clarity and peace reflected in the tranquil lake surface.
But what happens when a stone, thrown from an unknown source, lands on the mirrored surface of the water?
The Kwon family was like this lake that everyone admired and used as an example. But then a stone called
"the game of Go" came flying.

Until the late eighties, student anti-government assemblies gathered every spring in Korea, held in
almost all schools. Cynics called it an "annual ritual". Anti-government assemblies during Wook's time
were quite primitive; neither students nor the police had experience. There were no things like
"Molotov cocktails," rubber batons, or even warn-out gas masks. The typical scenario of "student riots":
students gathered on the street and sang until the police arrived. The police used tear gas, and the
students ran away. No serious injuries or arrests. Everything was peaceful enough. Compared to
demonstrations in later years, the "riots" at that time were rather romantic.

On that day, one of these assemblies was taking place. On his way to school, Wook encountered the
demonstration just when tear gas grenades had been used, and students started running away from the police.
What could the naive 15-year-old Wook think? Students were running from the police, so he also should run.
Frightened Wook ran as fast as he could, away from the police. He wasn't one of those chased by the police,
but it didn't matter. He ran and ran. After a while, he found himself in a fairly quiet neighborhood.
Breathing heavily, he looked around: no police, no running students. Still afraid, Wook wanted to find
a place to hide. He saw a sign: "Chunjin Go Club." In search of shelter, he went inside.

He saw a few pairs playing Go. Suddenly, a strange shiver ran through his body. It was mysterious,
yet a satisfying feeling, similar to what he experienced a couple of nights ago - a pleasant excitement.

Certainly, he had seen people playing Go in various places before. But this was different. Here, all
the players sat in the same posture, with identical serious expressions on their faces, playing Go where
no other games were played. Wook sensed that the game of Go he had seen before was distinct from the one
he was observing now. A sudden desire arose to learn how to play.

A middle-aged man, apparently the club owner, approached Wook.

"Hi, how skilled are you at Go?"
"Well, I don't know how to play."
"Are you looking for someone?"
"No. I came here to learn to play."

Wook surprised himself hearing those words. Understanding that it was precisely what he was thinking
at that moment, he gathered courage and looked the man in the eyes, as if demanding an answer.
"Really? Good idea. This is the best game invented by humans. Let me give you a lesson right now."
The kind offer from the owner suddenly made Wook realize that he was expected at home.
"Thank you. I'm sorry, but I have to be home. Can I come another day?",
Wook felt discomfort in the inconsistency of his actions. However, the man didn't object.
"Of course, no problem. To start with, I'll give you some Go books. I know many strong players
from the "K" school. Not surprising, the best students can be the best in Go too.", He seemed pleased
with Wook's uniform from the top school.

The two books he gave Wook were titled "First Steps in Go" and "Elementary Go Theory." Hurrying home, Wook
felt like he was carrying a treasure. At first, the books were incomprehensible to Wook, but he was still
interested in reading. He read both books in one go. From the next day, Wook came to the Go club every day.
In July, before the summer break, Wook became a 9th kyu. Student ranks in Go start from 18 kyu and progress
to 1 kyu, or the first dan. Then players can become masters (dan) and rise to 9 dan. Achieving 1 kyu for
most people is an impossible task. Achieving 9 kyu in a few months is remarkably fast progress.

When summer vacation began, Wook became a regular at the new Go club "Dong-A," closer to home.
The newly minted player spent the entire summer vacation there. As soon as his father left for work,
after having breakfast, Wook ran to the club and stayed until closing time, around 11 PM.

Mr. Kwon learned about his son's interest but didn't attempt to hinder it. He didn't consider Go
a threat or danger. He felt it was better than typical teenage behavior like loud music and hanging
out with friends. Wook sensed this silent approval and diligently attended the club. The worst reaction
he faced was occasional disapproving comments like, "Go is a game for retirees, not young people like you."

Mr. Kwon was aging. At fifty-five, his character had significantly softened. Wook's brothers and sisters
were pleased that Wook avoided troubles by spending his days in the club. Fortunately or unfortunately,
circumstances allowed Wook to focus on studying the game. At the end of the vacation, after just five
months of practice, he achieved the sixth kyu, surprising everyone in the club with his rapid progress.
Undoubtedly, Wook possessed a certain talent.

The stone thrown into the lake created a small ripple.

FIRST KYU

Nowadays, achieving the first kyu isn't difficult; the number of players has significantly increased
over the years. However, the increase in quantity often diminishes quality, and the first kyu
doesn't command the same respect it did thirty years ago. Achieving the first kyu was a
rarity in the 1960s.

The owner of the 'Chunjin Go Club' once told Wook, 'A first kyu can reconstruct the
entire game from memory if someone knocks the stones off the board. We have a first
kyu in our club. He's not here today, but you'll definitely see him.'

Soon, Wook encountered the first kyu. The club owner had 7 kyu compared to Wook's
15 kyu, giving him a nine-stone handicap. However, on that day, the first kyu played
against the owner, receiving, instead of giving, a nine-stone handicap!

The first kyu was a young man in his twenties, slim and pale. Almost everyone in the
club gathered to watch the game. Judging by sighs and sweat on the owner's face, it
seemed like he was losing. When he finally resigned, the first kyu stood up, stating
he had to leave. The owner pleaded for him to stay, but the first kyu, smiling, politely
declined, promising to return soon. The owner went to his office and brought back several
packs of 'Chungja' (the most expensive brand of cigarettes), and, after a few ceremonial
refusals, handed them to the first kyu. Wook noticed he wore an old suit with patches on
the elbows. But that didn't matter; he was like a Christ in the flesh, or even more.
How to become the first kyu? How to become a god?

As Wook started attending the club more frequently, he met several first kyus.
A bald middle-aged man, a young man in his twenties wearing a beret, an old man
with a cane. They all looked different but commanded the same respect from other
players. When they played, everyone watched in dead silence. When they spoke about
the game, everyone listened attentively. They were all poor.

In Wook's new club, 'Dong-A,' there was also a first kyu. Nobody knew his full name,
and people simply called him Master Lee. He resembled a fugitive: worn-out black army
pants, rubber boots clearly too big for him, and hair in need of an urgent cut and wash.
But his appearance didn't matter once he entered the club. Everyone addressed him as Master.
He came to the club rarely and played only a few games each time. His games always attracted
attention. All games were with a handicap against weaker players, and Wook never saw him lose.
In the most unlikely situations, he always had a move that resurrected his seemingly killed
groups of his opponent.

After each of his infrequent visits, he would leave the club with a few packs of expensive
"Chungja" cigarettes given to him by the club owner. Upon receiving the cigarettes, he would
hurriedly open a pack and take a drag, as if he hadn't smoked for a very long time.
He never discarded his own cheap "Swan" cigarettes; instead, he carefully placed them
in his breast pocket and then left the club, puffing the expensive smoke with an air
that suggested he wouldn't be seen here again, at least for a few days.

August was coming to an end. To Wook's irritation, the summer vacation was drawing to
a close. His daily visits to the Go club would soon have to stop. That morning, Wook
came to the club as usual. It was still early, and there were not many players. Wook
joyfully spotted Master Lee playing in the corner. Fortunately for Wook, there was no
usual crowd of spectators nearby. Only Mr. Chang, who played at Wook's level – 6 kyu –
was enjoying a vacant spot "near the ring." After a small but polite bow, Wook sat next
to the tailor. Mr. Chang greeted Wook with a wide smile.

Master Lee was playing with a boy of the same age as Wook. Wook wondered how many
handicap stones the boy was taking from Master Lee, but he was surprised to see
that there was no handicap at all. The boy, no older than Wook, was playing an even
game with Master Lee! What was even more astonishing, Master Lee clearly had problems.
Master Lee, who had never spent more than a few seconds on his move before, was now
deeply in thought. His gaze wandered distractedly across the board. Wook had never
seen anything like it before.

After a long pause, Master Lee sighed:

"I surrender. The group cannot be saved."

Master Lee had just lost the game! And to a child! It was unbelievable.
But what followed was even more surprising. It all started with Mr. Chang's innocent question:

"Master Lee, couldn't you have saved the group by simply escaping instead of cutting?"

Lee indecisively replied:

"Well, maybe..."

But the boy suddenly interrupted:

"I don't think so. Extension loses one liberty."

The tailor chimed in:

"I think having two eyes makes it a ko."

The boy raised his voice in irritation:

"Sir, how strong are you? I'm a second kyu, and I think the group couldn't survive!"

Dead silence fell. It might have been wrong for Mr. Chang, a weaker player, to insist
on his assumptions, but for the boy who raised his voice against a man who had just
lost a game, it was unforgivable. It didn't matter who was right; in Korea, disrespect
towards elders was the worst form of behavior.

The sudden sharpness of the boy embarrassed Mr. Chang. To conceal his feelings, he began
fumbling in his pockets, as if searching for cigarettes. Master Lee broke the silence:

"Dong! You better apologize to Mr. Chang right now. Such behavior is unacceptable,
especially among players."

The boy named Dong muttered a few words of apology. However, obviously offended,
he quickly stood up and left the club.

"Nothing serious, nothing serious. It was my mistake! Can a 6 kyu give advice to a master!"

the good-natured tailor's response defused a situation that could have turned much worse.
Master Lee suggested a teaching game, as if compensating for the insult, adding:

"This child will soon be a great player. Remember my words! He has what a good
player should have: courage. Although from time to time, he behaves improperly...
Besides, he insists that he is a second kyu, although there are few first kyus
better than him. Yes, he is a second kyu, a professional! Ha-ha-ha!"

"What does professional mean, Master Lee?"

"He is an insei of the Korean Go Association. He has his own ranking system from
12 kyu to 1 kyu. Their ranks change every month based on tournament results.
The ranks differentiate their positions relative to each other, but an insei
at 12 kyu is as strong as a 1 kyu in the outside world."

"So, an insei at 12 kyu can beat you, Master Lee?"

"Of course! I've lost many games to insei at 11 and 12 kyu."

Wook suddenly felt a strong headache. His goal was to become a first kyu like Master Lee.
But what was this nonsense about insei? It seemed like Go had no upper limit:
mastering one ladder required climbing another to become a strong player.
Wook wanted to meet Dong again. He was roughly the same age and could be a friend.
He could share many secrets of the game. However, Dong did not return to the club
until the summer vacation ended.

Progress slowed as a player became stronger. Wook's rapid rise to the rank of 6 kyu
had stalled, despite all attempts to improve. It took him another five months to become
a 3 kyu. The third kyu was considered a good player, entitled to demand respect from other players.

To reach the third kyu, Wook sacrificed every spare minute, studying games of professional
players and searching for rare books in second-hand stores. Although Wook was annoyed by
his slow progress, the fact that he achieved the strength of the third kyu in less
than a year was a significant rarity.

Meanwhile, Wook's performance in school significantly declined. Mr. Kwon, who had
previously looked favorably on his son's hobby, began to frown.

"Son, Go is for those who want to kill time, for idlers and the unemployed. But not
for young people who must work hard and study! I hope you understand that our family's
reputation could suffer because of you. I hope you're not planning to disappoint me?"

Although Wook's academic performance worsened, it wasn't to the extent that Mr. Kwon
became seriously concerned. Senior Kwon still believed that Wook would come to his senses.

Contrary to his father's wishes, Wook's life now revolved solely around the game.
The third kyu was a good player, but the path from the third kyu to the first
required great efforts. People who stopped at the level of the third kyu were
much more numerous than those at the first kyu level. To achieve the first kyu,
one needed not only time and hard work but also talent and inspiration.

It took Wook another year to reach the first kyu. But he did it! On the day Wook
won his tenth game in a row against Master Lee, Wook also became a Master.
People started calling him "Master Kwon" or "Kwon - first kyu."

During his second year of school, Wook matured significantly. He grew taller and
more mature. In addition, he achieved a prestigious status in Go. In two years,
Wook changed a lot.

Now that he was a first kyu, the desire to meet Dong grew. Strangely, he never
encountered Dong again since their first meeting. Wook asked Master Lee how
strong Dong was.

"Well, on two stones, you'll probably win, but on one - no."

Very strong. Practically unbelievable, thought Wook. Now he was confident that he
could put up a good game on two stones even against a strong professional player.
But according to what Master Lee said, Dong was almost as strong as a professional.
Yet, Dong never became a professional. Wook didn't quite understand. This indicated
that he still had much to learn. Overconfidence is one of the characteristics of weak players.

Wook was still weak.

DONG

The "Dong-A" Go club was forced to close. In those days, owning a Go club was not a
reliable business. The main source of income for most clubs was the daily entrance
fee of 30 won, allowing players to stay in the club for an unlimited time. Regardless
of the number of games played or the time spent in the club, the 30-won fee did not
cover the club owner's expenses such as rent and, say, the salary of the caretaker.
The owner of "Dong-A" decided to close the club when he owed rent for several months.

Not far from "Dong-A," there was another club called "YC", located in the market area
on the second floor of an old deteriorating building. It was much smaller than "Dong-A",
but the worse conditions actually gave "YC" an advantage: the rent was much lower than
that of "Dong-A." Moreover, there was a small room hidden behind the main hall in the
club where poker and other card games with low stakes were played 24 hours a day.
This brought the owner of "YC" much more income than the 30 won he collected from
Go players for entry.

Before the bankruptcy of "Dong-A," few people went to the "YC" club because of the worse
playing conditions and atmosphere. Now, however, "YC" became the only place where local
players could gather. The owner of "YC" decided to welcome new members by announcing a
tournament sponsored by himself. The tournament announcement created expected excitement
among players, even though the prizes were bags of rice and Go books. When a man brought
home a bag of rice, his wife understood why he devoted so much time to the game. Players
rarely bought Go books for themselves, so book prizes were also appreciated. But prizes
weren't the main reason for the excitement. Players simply loved tournaments.

Naturally, Wook began participating in his first tournament. Wook was surprised to see
Dong at the tournament, with whom he hadn't crossed paths since their first meeting.
In a year and a half, Wook had grown from the sixth kyu to the first kyu, while Dong
registered as a second kyu.

The tournament had three groups, each playing with handicaps. In Group A, where Wook
played, participants ranged from the first to the fourth kyu.

As the tournament progressed, potential winners and favorites started to emerge.
In Group A, Wook and Dong were the only ones without losses, and they were set
to play against each other to determine the tournament winner.

Since Dong entered the tournament as a second kyu, he played with black without komi.
Wook was nervous about whether he could defeat Dong, because then he will become the
best player in this part of the city. The prospect of such fame gave him the necessary
support. Dong seemed a bit puzzled that his peer had a first kyu, but he took a bowl
of black stones and bowed to Wook, suggesting to start a game.

Although Dong remained a second kyu, he had noticeably changed externally.
His hair was neatly combed, and a pack of cigarettes in the shirt pocket made
him look almost like an adult. He had also grown taller. Wook was so surprised
by Dong's appearance that he struggled to focus on the game.

Dong was strong. The energy of his stones, supported by deep calculation, dominated
the board. Wook remembered what Master Lee had said, that Dong was almost two stones
stronger than Wook.

The game ended, almost not starting. Seizing the lead by about ten points early in
the game, the black stones didn't give a chance to turn the game around. Wook resigned.
After Dong took the black stones, the game didn't go well. Dong won the tournament.
Players started to disperse. Winners went home to boast about their prizes, and
losers went to the "Double Widow" bar to drown their losing moves.

Wook was tired and about to go home to rest. He was already at the exit, along
with his prizes — Go books — when he heard Dong's voice:

"Don't you want to play again?"

"Of course! But it seems you play stronger...",hinted Wook about Dong's inaccurate rank.
"Maybe we'll play on equal terms?", suggested Wook after a short pause.

"Fine, sir!", Dong's tone was distinctly polite: "Sir." Wook felt awkward.
The drawing gave black stones to Wook. He sighed with relief — black color would at
least give him some chance to win. The tension, which seemed to disappear after
the first game, was returning. Wook placed the first stone in the upper right corner...

The game entered the middle stage when a young man entered the club. He and Dong
exchanged brief greetings. Wook thought it must be Dong's friend. Sitting by the
board, the young man paid no attention to the position. Wook thought that Dong's
acquaintance was definitely not a Go player, just someone who came to meet him.
The suit and the cigarette in his mouth made him look older, but the pimples on
his face indicated that he was underage. After a while, he looked at Wook for
the first time and exclaimed:

"Are you Wook? Didn't recognize me? Iku - from the elementary school?!"
"Yes! Now I remember. You've changed. I didn't recognize you right away", replied Wook.

Wook, the strongest in the school, was respected by characters like Iku, the troublemakers.
They had something in common. Wook was delighted to meet his old friend.

"Are you this guy's friend?", nodded Wook towards Dong.

This guy? Oh, my God! Don't talk nonsense! He just follows my orders to stay alive.
Hm-m... I guess you could call him my friend. Anyway, guys, do you really want to
continue wasting time on this boring game? On the day when old friends reunite
after a long separation?! Wook and Dong looked at each other and began to gather
the stones. Dong was winning, and both knew it.

"Where do you want to go, Iku? Especially for a new person...", asked Dong with a smile.
He was also pleased with the opportunity to get to know Wook better.
"Come on, guys, cut it out: this guy and that guy! Relax! Today is February 8, 1968,
at seven thirty-four in the afternoon. I order you to be friends. Execute it immediately!
Ha-ha-ha-ha..."

So Wook and Dong became friends.

NEW FRIENDS

From that day on, the three of them were together. Wook learned that both Dong and Iku
dropped out of school last year. They told Wook that they became friends after bumping
into each other on the street.

Because of school, Wook couldn't be with them all day and limited the company's actions.
For instance, Wook couldn't wander around with them during the day. Also, there were places
like tea houses where students, especially in school uniforms, were not allowed to enter.
When Wook was in his school uniform, they couldn't freely smoke. Despite the friends not
objecting to these minor inconveniences, Wook, against school rules, stopped wearing the
uniform. Wook looked more and more like his two friends. He acquired a taste for alcohol
and tobacco, which would have made Mr. Kwon furious if he found out.

Moreover, Wook liked that he could often play Go with Dong, which had an impact on the
strength of his game — he could now show a good game with black stones without komi
against Dong.

For Wook, Iku was an amazing person. He had several girlfriends, most of whom were
older than him. In the days when Wook and Dong couldn't go with him, he could drink
alone in a bar. It was Iku who showed Wook the "real" bars. For Wook, Iku lived in
a different world.

One day, Wook and Dong were sitting in a tea house. They had just played a few games,
and they had about an hour of free time before meeting Iku at the "Renaissance" music club.
Since there was no time to play another game, they decided to relax, smoke, and have a cup
of coffee. Dong told Wook that he no longer played insei tournaments. He left because there
were too many strict rules and instructions, and they were closely monitored. If a player
insei, for example, avoided recording a professional game, they were not allowed to play
in the next tournament, which determined their status for the whole month. Leaving was
easy, explained Dong, but no one is accepted back. Yet he left.

"Don't get me wrong, Wook. I continue to study the game very seriously. I can progress on my own!"

But in Dong's voice, Wook heard hesitation. In fact, Dong looked scared every time the
qualification tournament was mentioned. Wook didn't quite understand Dong's fear; he was
sure that a player of his strength shouldn't have any problems becoming a professional.
No first kyu - Wook knew wasn't as strong as Dong.

Professional or master qualification tournaments organized by the Korean Go Association
were held twice a year in spring and autumn - this was the only way to become a professional.
The two winners of such a tournament became contenders for the professional first dan diploma.
Usually, the total number of participants in the tournament was around three hundred,
so becoming one of the top two was extremely difficult. However, contenders considered
themselves lucky because a few years ago, the rules were much stricter. Previously,
only one player became a professional in each tournament. Wook wanted to learn more
about the qualification tournament, not just the well-known facts and rules.

"Is it really so difficult to become a pro, Dong?!"

Wook cautiously brought up this topic again, and looking into Dong's eyes, he saw how he darkened.

"Yes, it's difficult... very difficult..."
"But, Dong, a strong player like you should have easily won this tournament."

Dong remained silent.

"Are there really so many people who play stronger than you?"

Dong frowned and stayed silent.

"Didn't you say you could play against the strongest pros at two stones?! How
many people there can be stronger than you?"

Dong still didn't bother to answer.

"Honestly, I was thinking about playing in this tournament..."

Dong exploded:

"You?! You stand no chance!"
"Why not? If I put in a little effort, I could..."
"Never!"
"Am I such a bad player?! You know, I'm also a strong first kyu!"

Wook was slightly offended. Dong could have answered more diplomatically.

"Okay, I don't want to offend you. I'm just telling the truth. There are hundreds
of players who play at the professional level. I'm sure you're a strong player too.
But, besides strength, you need luck. How many really strong players haven't become
professionals just because luck wasn't on their side! And for you, Wook, even strength
won't be enough. My best result in this tournament was advancing to the next round of
the preliminary tournament. And to enter the main tournament, you have to go through
three preliminaries!"

"You know what surprises me, Wook? Why the hell do you want to become a professional?
You study at the best school, you come from a wealthy family... I have none of that.
Becoming a pro is the only way for me to succeed in life. You're a good player, a strong
first kyu. People will respect you more if you succeed in other things. You have a great
future in the regular world... Okay, look at the time. We're late. Iku is waiting for us
with the girls!""

Wook remained puzzled. But they needed to hurry from the tea house to "Renaissance".
They rushed off. Meeting Iku was always exciting. What did he have planned for today?
Soon, both friends forgot about such unpleasant things as the qualification tournament
and school.

In "Renaissance", Iku sat with three girls around their age. The girls looked like high
school students but tried to appear more mature. Naive Wook and Dong didn't approach the
group but sat in a corner, watching Iku from a distance.

After a moment, Iku ran up to them:

"What are you doing here?! I saved these chicks especially for you! They're volleyball
players from "S" girls' school. Come with me, lively! Why do I have to spoon-feed you
all the time? Let's go!""

Wook felt awkward, but he was excited. The girls were pleasant and cheerful. Wook and
Dong were inexperienced in this matter, so Iku's "spoon-feeding" was appreciated once
again. Soon, the six teenagers were noisy enough to draw frowns from the neighboring
tables. Visitors to "Renaissance" came to listen to classical music, preferably in
absolute silence, so the new acquaintances left. They headed to the "Roman Bakery",
where not only talking but shouting was allowed.

They ordered ice cream. The conversation became noisy and more interesting.
Iku continued to play the role of the leader, and it seemed like the group
had known each other for months. Iku's imagination was boundless.

"Ladies and gentlemen! The way we're sitting is against national tea etiquette;
it's too nonsensical. We must turn the group of six people into three pairs.
I suggest drawing lots. I understand, all the girls want to be with me, but alas,
I can't fulfill these wishes."

"Yes, he's not embarrassed at all!"
"I wonder if I could ever become so cheeky?"
"At least we'll each get a partner."

Iku's proposal was met with reluctant approval from the girls, and they tore a
napkin into six pieces, writing names on it.

After the "drawing," they paired up. A tall girl named Inae became Wook's partner.
An awkward silence fell. It's one thing to casually chat in a group, and another
to get to know a girl. For a seventeen-year-old boy, it was a significant difference.
Iku decided to break the ice.

"Inae! You're lucky. Your partner is a student at K-school!"
"Yes, and his father is the President."

Inae looked at Iku. But Iku stood his ground.

"I'm serious! He really..."
"Iku, why do you have to talk about this? Stop, please!",

interrupted Wook. He thought that when Dong or Iku were around, it was better not to
mention it. But Wook's unexpected revelation, on the contrary, convinced Inae.

"So it's true?! You really are from "K" school?", exclaimed Inae.
"Yes, but I don't think it's interesting."
"It's very interesting! Hey, Sok! Look! Did you hear? He's a student at K-school!"

The girls' glances were surprised and envious, which surprised Wook. He never
thought that his social status could impress girls. In his family, it was a common fact.
However, the envy of the girls didn't last long. It seemed they were happy with their
partners. Dong was talking to Sok the whole time. After several trays of donuts and buns,
Won suddenly shouted:

"Oh my God! I have to go! My older brother will kill me if I come home after
nine. And it's already ten! Ah-ha!"

This statement dispersed the new acquaintances. Won's life, however, was nothing
to be afraid of—she continued talking:

"Iku, Dong, Wook, come the day after tomorrow to the Chang stadium at seven in
 the evening. We'll be playing in the semifinals. We need your support!"
"Wook, will you come? — winked Inae. — Will you wear your school uniform?"

Chuckling, the girls hurried out of the "Bakery."
The young men went back to the "YC" club, excitedly exchanging impressions.
Iku taught his friends strategies for dealing with girls.

Inae liked Wook. She liked him right away. She was the first girl he knew personally.
Before this, all his experience with girls was limited to school-sanctioned group meetings,
which allowed boys and girls to meet in groups. It was different. And she had beautiful big eyes.

Wook thought about her request to come in a school uniform. It wasn't a good idea. How would he
look next to Iku and Dong, who dropped out of school and weren't too proud of it? Wook decided
to go to the game but not in uniform. There was nothing special about studying at K-school,
he reminded himself constantly.

PARK INAE

Outside the stadium, a huge flag from the national volleyball championship
for girls greeted three fans. (Today's game was a semifinal - the girls from "S"
and "P" schools were playing.)

"No one is allowed in the female locker room and the adjacent area.
Wait until the game is over."

Experienced Iku easily led his friends to the stands and found three
standing places in the supporters' section of school S. There were quite
a few people, mostly girls from both schools.

Wook smiled awkwardly, imagining how he looked in his student uniform.
He tried to explain to himself, justify his strange behavior. The old
jacket was in places with holes and looked provocative, but hadn't he
worn this jacket before without considering it indecent? He contradicted
his own reasoning time and again, at the end, he had to admit that he wore
the High School uniform to show off. Perhaps he wanted to please Inae.
Maybe he wanted to show her his superiority. Maybe he considered Inae
more important than Iku and Dong. Now Wook regretted his foolish behavior.

A sharp whistle sounded: the game was starting. Players from both teams
lined up in front of the net, facing each other. Inae, Won, and Sok were
on the court. After shaking hands, the girls took off their warm jackets
and took their positions on the volleyball court.

Watching Inae play, Wook was surprised to find that volleyball and Go were
quite similar. Inae on the court was drastically different from the girl he
saw the day before. She was in excellent shape, combining everything needed
for a good game: trained muscles, speed, skill. Inae looked composed and tense,
just like he was during a Go match.

Watching her play, her skill, physical form, Wook felt ashamed. He had
never succeeded in sports. He felt embarrassed about his affiliation
with the high school. The very idea of showing off by wearing the school
uniform now seemed utterly foolish to him.

The game was exciting. After each team won one match, the most exciting
events began. To Wook's horror, in the third, deciding match, in a tense
and equal struggle where every point was crucial, school S had to concede
with a minimal gap in the score - 14:16. Inae and her friends were ready
to cry - they had just suffered a bitter defeat.

"Let's go to the locker room!" - Iku, indifferent to the game's outcome,
was only waiting for this moment. Wook and Dong hurried after him towards the exit.
The girls came off the court, disappointed and tired. Spotting Wook waiting for her,
the sad Inae brightened up:

"You came! Sorry, I look awful. Will you wait for me here?
I just need to take a shower and freshen up."

Inae hurried to the shower. Won and Sok also seemed to forget about
the game. Laughing, they ran to the shower.

"Guys! Won and I will take a stroll without you. After the game,
she needs a distraction," Iku's mischievous intent was met with approval
from the others. Wook also wanted to spend time alone with Inae, not
caring about his friends.

The three friends dispersed and started waiting. Wook took a distant
corner so that no one would accidentally bump into him. Where to take
Inae - Wook tried to plan the evening. A suitable place seemed to be
a cafe - she must be hungry after the game. Where to go after the cafe?
Building vague plans for the future with a barely familiar girl was quite
amusing.

"There you are! Why are you waiting here? Where are the others? Ah, I see.
They wanted to continue without us. I'm fine with that too!"

Inae stood behind Wook. With shiny hair falling on her shoulders after
the shower, she looked great.

"Where are they? They were just here!"

Wook clumsily lied, trying to hide the shameless agreement with the guys.

"Let's not worry about them. Come, I'll introduce you to someone."

Introduce him to someone? Maybe that troublemaker - Won's brother?
Or another guy she also invited to the game? Wook felt some awkwardness
about the upcoming event.

With relief, he saw a middle-aged woman with a friendly smile.

"This is my mom. Mom, this is my friend!"

Wook was surprised that Inae introduced him to her mother without a shadow
of doubt. Mr. Kwon wouldn't approve of her behavior. In his view, a high
school student is not allowed to have a girlfriend or friend.

"Nice to meet you. What a wonderful student!"

It seemed that Wook's high school uniform received immediate approval.
Inae surprised him more and more.

"Let's go to our house. You don't mind, Mom?"
"Of course! I'll prepare something delicious for both of you."

It was an event completely incomprehensible to Mr. Kwon. Inae invited Wook
into the house, and her mother supported this idea! Their car was imported,
a rarity for Korea at that time, and it was driven by a chauffeur in white gloves.
This was another surprise for Wook, who was expecting a bus or taxi ride.
Slightly shocked, Wook remained mostly silent during the journey while Inae
chatted continuously with him and her mother. They arrived at a huge mansion.
Behind iron gates was a well-kept courtyard with a pond. The living room's
distinctive feature was a thick, large white carpet with a tiger skin in the
middle. Modern oil paintings on the walls contrasted with a collection of
antique Korean ceramics on the wooden wall.

Seating Wook on a leather sofa, Inae went to her room to change. Wook looked
around - he saw real wealth for the first time in his life. The Kwon family
was well-off, but what Wook saw here was incomparable - it was another level.
Unexpectedly, Wook's eyes fell on a goban; like everything else in the room,
it looked very expensive. The six-inch thick kaya board was a rarity in itself.
What truly surprised Wook was the autograph on the bottom: Kitani Minoru 9 dan.

Kitani 9 dan was a teacher of Master Cho, the founder of the Korean Go Association.
Damn it, who was Inae's father, the owner of a board with Kitani's autograph?!
Wook lifted the lid of the bowl with white stones. With his fingertips, he felt
the smooth surface of polished cool shells. Wow! Real shells, polished by hand!

"My dad loves playing. He brags about this board ever since he bought it in Japan.
He says he played with the best player in Japan and got his autograph."

Inae, now wearing a green sweater and blue jeans, stood next to him.

"Your dad played with Kitani himself? Wow!"
"Do you know how to play too? Great! You can play with my dad when he comes back."
"Do you know how strong he is at the game?"
"He says he's 3 dan. Look - his diploma is hanging on the wall."

The diploma of Mr. Sangsu Park in a beautiful frame indicated that he was
an amateur 3 dan. Although Korean players were not yet familiar with the
amateur dan system, the Korean Go Association issued such diplomas for
people with high social standing. The fee for the service was conditional;
however, diploma recipients, usually wealthy and influential, made substantial
donations that exceeded the official fee. It was one of the main sources of
income for the Association.

In the guide for issuing these diplomas, it was indicated that the first kyu
was equivalent to the diploma of an amateur 3 dan, the highest level at that
time. Nevertheless, these diplomas were mainly awarded for political and
financial motives, and the true strength of the recipient didn't matter much.
The priority for issuing these diplomas was the willingness and ability to make
donations. Therefore, Wook couldn't be sure of the strength of Mr. Park,
the amateur 3 dan.

Inae's mother, entering with a tray of appetizing food, greeted the news:

"How wonderful! Please stay. Inae's father loves playing with new opponents.
He'll be back soon; the driver has already gone to fetch him."
"Thank you, but... I really need to get home. It's getting late."
"Where do you live? In District K? Okay, it's just a five-minute drive.
We'll drop you off. Please stay; you'll meet Inae's father."

In reality, Wook wanted to play with Mr. Park. He was curious about how
strong Inae's father was at the game, although the prospect of playing
with Mr. Park as a friend of his daughter made him uneasy. Mr. Kwon would
not have approved of a friend of his daughter's coming to his house and
playing Go with him. But maybe there's nothing wrong with it, as Inae's
mom doesn't seem to mind, Wook decided to boldly embrace the unknown.

He could always escape from the house if things went wrong.
Mr. Park arrived shortly. Inae's mom must have told him about Wook because,
upon entering the room, he immediately set up the goban.

"Hello! I heard you play. Let's have a game. Inae, you should cheer for me."
"No, Dad. I'll be an impartial judge."
"In Go, there's no need for referees. By the way, what's your strength?"
"I'm 1 kyu..."
"1 kyu! I'm in a difficult position today, Inae. He not only knows how to
play but is also a good player! Okay, I'll play with black."
"But, sir, you're 3 dan..."
"Ah, that?! Nonsense! I'm roughly 2 kyu."

Mr. Park's insistence forced Wook to play with white.
Mr. Park, in his forties, had a good build and seemed like a very
pleasant person. He seemed unperturbed by the fact that there was a
friend of his daughter in the living room. Moreover, he appeared to
be pleased with the visit. Wook continued to be amazed.

During the game, Inae's mom entered with tea for her husband. She commented
with a smile:

"It seems like you really like him, dear. After all, she invited
a boy into the house for the first time."
"Oh, is that so! You're serious about him, aren't you, Inae?"
"Dad!"

What a conversation between a father and daughter! Wook couldn't believe
what he saw and heard. They were joking with each other about him and with him,
being barely acquainted with him!

Mr. Park was not a match for Wook. Wook could have easily given him two handicap
stones. But out of courtesy, Wook didn't press too hard. A crushing victory over
his daughter's father would be inappropriate. He hoped to win with a slight advantage.
During these vain musings, Mr. Park interrupted Wook - he surrendered.

"Yes, Inae. He's not just a good player. He's a master!"
"But you lost by just a little."
"I've played a lot with professionals and can sense when a stronger opponent
isn't playing at full strength out of courtesy... Okay, I think I need at least
three handicap stones to play with you. You can be my teacher."
"Then ask him to come more often, Dad."
"Of course. But sorry, Inae, you won't be able to communicate with him during
his visits. I won't let him off his teaching duties."
"That's okay; I'll also learn to play, Dad!"
"Wow! You really are into him. By the way, Wook, want another
game with a three-stone handicap?"
"With pleasure... But it's already late."
"How late is it? Oh, it's already half past ten. I'll ask the driver..."
"There's no need to worry; I'll take the bus."
"No and no! Let me do this for myself! If I treated Inae's friends poorly, she would make my life miserable."
"Dad! You're the best!"

Inae ran up to her father and kissed him on the cheek. Wook's sisters never
approached the elder Kwon closer than a meter, and Mr. Park allowed his daughter
to kiss him on the cheek, and he liked it. It was yet another surprise.
In Inae's car, she briefly told Wook about her family.

"My grandfather owns all the companies in the S Holding. My father is the
younger of his two sons. My father studied physics in America, leaving the elder
brother to take over Grandpa's business. But Dad's business grew, and the elder
brother couldn't handle it alone."

Then my father was recalled home by my grandfather to take charge of several companies.
My mother's family manages a group of companies in the S holding. My parents' marriage
took place for family reasons between the two families, but surprisingly, my parents
turned out to be very happy in marriage. They love each other a lot, and my father
loves the family more than anything else in the world. I am their only child.

Wook began to understand Mr. Park's behavior, who, by Korean standards, behaved
unusually. In America, he became a real revelation, that's what it was!

When they approached the house, Inae handed Wook a small piece of paper.

"My phone number. Call me!"

Wook wanted to give her his number, but he changed his mind in time. What if Inae
suddenly calls and finds him home alone with his father? No, never!
As expected, his father didn't like that Wook came back so late and not from
the library, but he only mildly scolded his son. Wook, with relief, went to his
room and lay down on the bed without undressing. So much happened today!
Inae's graceful movements on the volleyball court, a goban with Kitani's autograph,
Inae's mother with a friendly smile, charming Mr. Park, and Inae's smile when she
gave him her phone number in the car.

That night, Wook couldn't fall asleep.

NEK

The next two months were winter holidays. During this time, Wook played with
Dong almost every day at the "YC" club and also met Inae frequently. There was
no progress in the game; Wook still had to play against Dong as black.

However, there was significant progress in Wook's relationship with Inae.
Almost every day, Wook called her or visited her at home. They went to the
movies or just took a walk, and sometimes they stayed at home, listening to
music and talking. If Mr. Park found Wook there, they played a few games, and
Inae watched. On those rare days when Wook couldn't come to her house, Inae
came to the club and waited for him to finish playing. Interestingly,
encountering Iku and Dong, Inae didn't mind going to the movies with all three
guys together. Even Iku, who was skeptical about all the girls in one group,
liked Inae. He congratulated Wook on his undeniable success in befriending such
a pretty girl. Wook really liked Inae, and she reciprocated his feelings. During
their walks, they held hands when Wook was out of uniform. Although walking with
a girl, holding hands or not, violated the school rules and was strictly prohibited.

Wook was upset about the lack of progress in the game. He would have been happy to
advance by just one stone, to alternate between black and white with Dong. Wook's
dissatisfaction was noticeable, and Dong tried to reassure him:

"You're worrying for nothing. Well, if there's no improvement, so be it.
At your level, it's almost impossible to progress even by half a stone.
Maybe I'm stronger, but not enough to help you strengthen. You need a teacher,
at least three or four stones stronger than you."

A person who was two or three stones stronger than Wook should have been a real
professional. Obviously, finding such a person was practically impossible.

Wook was still deeply upset because the idea of becoming a professional player
had taken root in his mind. However, for someone with a first kyu, the desire
to become a professional was quite natural. But at that time, professional Go
players earned very little. The game was not as popular as it is today, and
consequently, finding sponsors for professional tournaments was challenging.
To survive, professionals often had to engage in gambling. Ironically, becoming
a professional in Go was very difficult: after rigorous selection, only four
people a year became professionals.

The desire to become a professional stemmed more from ambition than financial
considerations for the First Kyu, but once the First Kyu got used to such respect,
their ego demanded a new dose of glory and honor. The spirit of competition drove
them to test their mastery against other holders of a similar rank to become a
"Super First Kyu." Becoming a professional, passing the qualifying tournament –
only that would satisfy their pride.

These were the reasons for the First Kyu to dream of becoming a professional and
be ready to face a challenging and financially insecure life. Most people, including
psychologists, dismissed those dreaming of becoming professionals as crazy. Slowly
but surely, Wook was becoming one of those nerds. All of Wook's efforts were
directed toward realizing his dream, and his frustration at the lack of progress
in the game was entirely understandable. As Dong had mentioned, Wook needed a teacher.

In reality, Wook had improved significantly after getting to know Dong, but there
were still several steps to overcome to become a professional. In the absence of a
teacher, having at least a few evenly matched sparring partners was essential,
however, Dong was the only one nearby, and others were too weak to help Wook improve.

The winter holidays came to an end, and in February, Wook completed his second
year of study. Ahead was a two-week break before the start of the final year.
In the morning, as usual, Wook went to the "YC" club.

At the club, Wook found Dong at a corner table, playing with a young man in his
twenties who wore dark glasses with a thick frame. Thinking that Dong was conducting
one of his teaching games, Wook approached the table and looked at the board.
To his surprise, this game was not one of Dong's lessons. The young man in glasses
played as white and, moreover, gave Dong a two-stone handicap!

Dong explained that when he was an insei, he played against professionals with a
two-stone handicap with varying success. Could Dong's partner be a top-class professional?
Wook recalled the faces of professionals known from magazines but couldn't identify
this person among them. Who on earth was he?

The game ended after an hour, and as a result, Dong lost by two points.

After tallying the score, the young man took a pack of "Swan" cigarettes from
his pocket and offered one to Dong. He lit Dong's cigarette first and soon lit one
for himself. Then his hand again slid into his pocket, and he took out a matchbox.
What was he looking for, interestingly? A matchbox? Ignoring Wook's curiosity,
the stranger didn't rush and rummaged in his pocket for a long time.

Finally, he pulled out a piece of a large matchbox. Striking a match, the man first
lit Dong's cigarette and soon released a large puff of smoke himself. He didn't even
have his own matches! It was unpleasant to see a person who used a match most likely
stolen from some cafe table. Matches cost only two won, and even a beggar on the street
didn't have such problems!

Nevertheless, this strange man had just given two stones handicap to Dong, the
strongest player Wook knew, and won! Who on earth was he, damn it?

"Well, it seems I missed the mark. Giving two stones in the corner and allowing
whites to play first here means losing at least two and a half points."

The comments of this person were hard to understand. Without a doubt, he could
give two stones to Dong. Dong, disappointed by the defeat, listened silently.
Then he looked around and noticed Wook for the first time.

"Hi. Been following the game?"
"From somewhere in the middle. Did you take two stones?"
"Yes... Let me introduce you. This is my brother, Nek, Nek Yun Kim. Ever heard this name?"
"No... Is he a pro?"
"No-no, I'm not a pro. I think I can play as black without a handicap."

Nek smiled friendly at Wook, who was now embarrassed by the fact that a non-professional
could beat Dong with a two-stone handicap.

"Brother Nek, could you play with my friend?"

Wook was grateful to Dong for this offer.

"Of course. What strength does he play?"
"Well, Wook, why don't you take four stones?"

Wook was outraged. Four stones?! Even against Kitani 9-dan, he wouldn't want
to take three stones! But soon he changed his mind. He would capture all the
white stones with such an advantage! Wook placed four stones on the board.

Wook, feeling confident, played quickly; Nek responded even faster. The game
reached the middle in less than ten minutes. As soon as one of Nek's groups got "stuck",
Wook increased the pace. He wanted to finish the game here and now. An analysis convinced
him that white group could be captured, with the next move, Wook acted like a triumphant.
To his surprise, Nek responded instantly and without any hesitation.

Wook thought again to confirm the accuracy of his calculations. There was no mistake:
he was capturing the group. Wook continued to play according to the plan, and Nek
responded as expected. The group of white stones was soon annihilated.

But the game was not over. During the struggle in which their group perished,
the white stones formed a wall. Utilizing it, Nek placed a stone right in the
middle of the black group, causing it to die without a chance of survival.
Wook was not prepared for this; the group he had captured was much smaller
than the one he had just lost. With no other option, Wook had to concede.
Now, he regretted being so insensitive, relentlessly pursuing victory.

"An example of an underestimated strategy — sacrifice by whites",

commented Nek briefly, stunning Wook. It turned out his mistake had become
the cause of the group's death, all part of Nek's plan!

"I feel you have great talent. If you practice a bit more, you could become a pro.
What do you think, Dong? Shall we go get some coffee?"

Nek looked pleased after the game with Wook. The three of them went to a teahouse
called "Lake." There, Dong, as if reading Wook's thoughts, briefly explained about
Nek and his life.

Many times, Nek had participated in qualification tournaments, almost becoming a
professional. First dans, when playing him for money, asked for a handicap, at
least five stones. Recently, he reached the final in the qualification tournament
for an international match. According to Dong, luck turned away from Nek, and that's
the main reason why he hasn't become a pro yet.

"Does a player need luck more than his skill, Dong?" Wook doubted.
"Everyone needs luck. And a lot of it..."

As Nek answered a question that Wook asked Dong, his face became sad. He lit another
cigarette, this time using matches from the table; his eyes followed the smoke rings.
Soon, Nek snapped out of his distracted state. Obviously, he wanted to change the subject
of conversation.

"Discussing such things is not interesting at all. Let's introduce ourselves officially.
My name, as you already know, is Nek Yun Kim. Born in 1948, the Year of the Rat. And you?
Oh, 1950, the Year of the Tiger! We're almost the same age. Let's be friends and call each
other by our first names. Or, if the two-year difference bothers you, just add the word 'brother'
before my name".

The guys became friends, and the game accelerated their bonding.
Dong left for some family matters. Wook and Nek stayed, conversing more freely.
There were plenty of topics to talk about, and both found it exceptionally enjoyable
to be in each other's company. If a visitor sits in a teahouse for more than two hours,
having ordered only a single cup of coffee and not ordering any snacks or something more,
the waitress begins to drop rather transparent hints. When such hints started to repeat,
they left the teahouse.

Wook decided to treat Nek to breakfast, remembering how he paid for three cups of coffee
with 150 won. Insisting that he would pay himself, Nek searched for a while for two hundred
won bills that got lost among the matchbox fragments and a few coins.

They went to a local restaurant where they ordered pork with noodles. Wook felt relieved
seeing Nek enjoying the noodles. He was sure that he had spent all the money intended for
breakfast on coffee.

After the restaurant, Nek invited Wook to his place. Wook had no reason to refuse; he was
happy to spend time with his new acquaintance.

The room Nek rented on the hill in the N area was terribly small and old. A tiny tea table
and a folded woolen blanket occupied most of the room. The rest of the space was just enough
for a person to lie down. Wook immediately had associations: Mr. Park's living room with a
tiger skin and Nek's room, removed by only four square meters; Mr. Park, who was three stones
weaker than Wook, and Nek, who was more than four stones stronger than him. It was easy to
conclude that Go and money practically had nothing in common. They sat on the floor at the
tea table. Nek took out half a bottle of soju and two plastic cups, poured soju, and handed
a cup to Wook.

"It's time to pour. Believe me, you have talent, and I'm saying this not just because we're
alone here. It's a talent that Dong can only dream of," said Nek, drinking the liqueur in one
gulp. Excited by such a high evaluation, Wook did the same.
"How do you know that after just one game, Brother Nek?"
"Because... I also have talent. I was surprised - your game strongly resembles my own.
But... in your game, there is still astonishing awkwardness. Being talented is a rare gift.
Talent itself does not guarantee the title of a professional. You need to study...
This morning at 'The Lake', I talked about luck. Yes, you need luck. But only those who
have dedicated enough time to study are worthy of it. Most fail due to insufficient diligence,
not because they are unlucky."
"If you've returned to this topic, let me ask. What failure befell you
in the qualification tournament?"

Nek poured the remains from the bottle into his cup and drank.

"What would you say about a guy who came in second three times in a row when only
one winner received the professional diploma? And then, when they changed the rules
and started giving diplomas to two winners, he still ended up in third place?"

It was evident that Nek needed another drink. He would have become a professional
long ago if the rules had changed a year or two earlier. He was a failure — there
was no other explanation.

"Sometimes I think luck has nothing to do with it. In reality, I wasn't strong
enough to be the first," he admitted, clearly disappointed that the bottle was
now empty. He took out a pack of "Swan" cigarettes from his pocket and lit one,
using the same match fragment. Without hurry, he continued.

"You need to start seriously practicing. Otherwise, you'll stay at the same level,
and that means death for your talent. Also, you need to participate in the qualification
tournament. Moreover, in the nearest one, even if you lose all the games in the first round.
The tournament will provide the best opponents in the country. The entry fee is three
thousand won. It's a significant amount for me. The Spring one will take place in March.
For me, it will be the last. Wouldn't it be amusing to play together in the same tournament?"

"Will you stop trying if it doesn't work out this time?", Wook inquired.
"No... I just won't be able to. I'm going to the army in April and won't
be able to play for three years. Who knows, maybe in three years, I'll be
much weaker due to a lack of practice. Besides, new players will emerge,
and the tournament will become even more challenging. If I'm going to do it,
I'll do it this time. That's why I consider this tournament the last."

Nek smiled. He must have already decided that the previous tournament was the last for him,
not the one scheduled for spring. Feeling sympathetic, Wook changed the subject.

"You said three things are needed to become a professional. The first is
strong sparring partners, what are the others?"
"Books and a teacher... You probably don't have any of the three right now."
"I've read several books... Association journals, problem collections,
joseki books, and a few others."

Wook felt offended that he was being taken for a fake first kyu who hadn't even
read the necessary books. Nek just smiled at Wook's protests.

"These are not the books for a first kyu dreaming of becoming a professional.
They're for those who want to kill time or be entertained. I'll show you a real book."

Nek flipped over the blanket rolled up in the corner — under it was a wooden box.
After rummaging there for a while, he pulled out a couple of books. He handed
one of them very carefully to Wook. The thick book titled "Game Records of Master Wu"
was stitched with threads, indicating it was published a long time ago.

Wook discovered that the book was written in Japanese.

"I can't read Japanese!"
"I can't either. You don't necessarily have to read the comments — or,
more precisely, you should never read them. Otherwise, you'll, at best,
become a copy of the person writing the comments. Just go through the games,
and the interpretations will come on their own. And it doesn't matter whether
it's in Japanese or Spanish. Have you ever heard of Master Wu? He's the Go God,
just like Master Dosaku. The Japanese call another one the Go God — Shusaku.
But for me, there are only two: Wu and Dosaku. When you go through their games,
a chill runs down your spine. I never felt that when watching Shusaku's games.
Maybe if I had studied Shusaku more than Dosaku, I would have become a pro by now."

Nek talked about people whose names Wook had never heard before. However, it was quite natural,
as Japanese books were practically unknown to Koreans. Wook already felt something mystical
in the book he held in his hands. Nek continued:

"This book is one of the few treasures I have. I don't think there's another copy anywhere
in Korea. I want to give you this book. You know why? Because you remind me of myself in Go.
I felt it for the first time during our game today. I hope that at least one of us can become
a pro, even if I fail, that's why I want you to take this book and become much stronger."

Wook couldn't say anything in response.

"If we don't meet again, this book may end up in the dump once I go to the army.
There are about three hundred games of Master Wu here. I've gone through them nine
times. So if you review each of them ten times, I think you can beat me."

Nek smiled sadly. He had reviewed all the games nine times! Over 2700 games! And yet,
he was about to surrender and pass the baton to Wook. Wook understood the conflicting
feelings overwhelming Nek.

"You don't need any more books. Now the third thing you need is a teacher.
But he's not as important as the first two points. A teacher can hinder the
development of your own unique style if you imitate his style... But if you
think you need all three things, I'll be your teacher."

Nek's words stirred Wook; today, he was offered two out of the three necessary
things to become a pro. Reviewing games ten times in a row didn't seem impossible
anymore. Wook, who was upset because he could only improve his game by half a stone,
now had the opportunity to advance by four!

Nek took the second book. It was much thinner than the previous one.

"This book is not entirely about Go, nevertheless, it should help you.
These are poems and short stories written by my friend. He was a poet.
He played well too, but one stone weaker than me. Like me, he tried many
times to win the qualification tournament, but unsuccessfully. Once he even
managed to reach the main tour. But last year, his parents, in pursuit of a
better life, emigrated to Canada and took him with them. Him – a guy who only
knew how to play Go and write poems in Korean! What is he doing there? He played
fantastically with a handicap against weaker opponents; he could give two stones
more than me. They even called him a hypnotist — anyone who sat against him played
as if under hypnosis.

This book is not published. He just compiled his poems and stories together.
There are a couple of poems about Go, those are the only ones I've read.
I don't understand poetry... There's also a short story called 'The Blood vommit game'
about an unfortunate professional Go player from Japan in the mid-19th century.
I think he attached a game record; let's take a look... Yes, here it is. First,
read the story, and then look at the game. It should teach you perseverance. To
become a pro, you have to be persistent and strong."

Wook's hands trembled slightly as he held the newly acquired books. His heart pounded
with a strong desire to flip through them immediately. Nek took his jacket and prepared
to leave, seemingly anticipating Wook's thoughts:

"I have to go now. I need to work to pay for the apartment. By seven, I have
to be in the U district."

Wook was very curious to know where Nek worked but tactfully kept quiet.
They took the bus together, and Wook exited first.

"Okay, I need to go. Can I stop by your place?"
"You might be wasting your time — I'm rarely home. I'll probably drop by 'YC'"
"That would be great if you could. Thanks for the books. Really, thank you."

Nek smiled.

Back home, Wook opened the book of poems first. The author was named Suk-won Hon.
The story "The blood vommit game" was at the end of the book.

THE GAME COUGHING BLOOD

On July 19, 1835, in Lord Matsudaira's castle, in a quiet room, two men sat facing each other. One of them, who could see the garden, was Meijin Jowa, 9th dan, forty-eight years old, from the Honinbo family. His opponent was Intetsu, 7th dan, twenty-six years old, from the Inoue family. The handicap was one stone, and Intetsu played as Black without komi. Before starting the game, both players sat with their eyes closed, meditating to clear their minds of unnecessary thoughts. It was easy for some of them to get distracted.

For Meijin Jowa, this was a game he could not afford to lose. The possession of the Meijin title—the highest Go title earned through years of political maneuvering and intrigue—was at stake. Jowa was uneasy about playing against Intetsu since he had lost to him in two previous games, although Intetsu played as Black at that time. If Jowa loses this game, Inseki, Intetsu's teacher, will challenge him to a match.

Inseki was the real victim of Jowa's intrigues, who, on the path to the title, had acquired many enemies. Jowa knew that Inseki and he were equally strong and had been avoiding games with him for the past few years. Jowa did not want to risk a possible defeat that would force him to part with the Meijin title. However, Jowa could not avoid a game with Intetsu, Inseki's student. The match was organized by Lord Matsudaira, and he was too influential for Jowa to dare decline the proposal for this game. Jowa decided to do everything possible to defeat the young and talented player from the rival family at any cost.

For Intetsu, there were almost more reasons to win. Inseki, Intetsu's teacher, Inesezu, had been a victim of Jowa's dishonest intrigues, which had almost destroyed his pride and self-respect. Only with Intetsu's victory, his teacher would have a chance to be honored with the title Meijin.

Master Inseki raised Intetsu as his own son after he was orphaned at an early age. He taught Intetsu the game, making him strong enough to avenge his teacher. For the grateful student, it was time to repay his debt to the teacher.

This game differed from the two previous ones they played. Today's meeting, with representatives from all four families, was official. Its result would be official enough for Inseki to file a petition for Jowa's reconsideration as Meijin. Nevertheless, Intetsu knew the formidable and powerful play of Jowa. Many times, his teacher had told him. Intetsu himself, repeatedly reviewing Jowa's games, realized each time how the awe-inspiring power could overwhelm the opponent. Be that as it may, he was obliged to win, for the sake of his teacher and the Inoue family. At any cost.

Intetsu opened his eyes and carefully placed a black stone in the lower-left corner against Jowa. Jowa, in turn, placed a white stone in his lower-right corner with a click. The game of the century had begun.

On the first day, 59 moves were made before they retired to their families for a two-day break. A new variation in the lower-left corner, specially developed in the Inoue family, was unexpected for Jowa. He made a mistake in response, and Intetsu took a confident lead.

Realizing he was falling behind, Jowa gathered his students in search of the next move, but to no avail. On the second night of the break, Jowa continued sitting at the board, feverishly trying to find the move that would turn the game in his favor. There was no such move. Jowa continued to sit, staring at the board, meditating from time to time, and trying to concentrate better. On the second night, exhausted, Jowa lost consciousness. Concerned, the family gathered around him. Finally, he woke up. His eyes sparkled. After hours of silence, he exclaimed, "I found it! I found it at last!" Later, it turned out that spirits came to Jowa and gave him hints for moves.

Intetsu spent two days meditating alone in a boat on the river. He was sure that there was still a long way to go before the finish. He well understood that maintaining the advantage until the end would be very difficult. Whatever they said, Jowa was Meijin, the best player in the country.

On July 21, the game resumed. Forty more moves were played before a three-day break. That day, Jowa made three brilliant moves that no one expected and turned the game in his favor.

On the third day, July 24, by move 172, Jowa gained a superior position. Jowa, a player of a higher rank, had the right to choose when to stop the game and take the final break. Confident of his success, Jowa announced the break on the third day, not intending to study the position further, and in three days, they would finish the game, as agreed.

During the break, Jowa worked with his students as if not remembering the game. Intetsu spent all three days in the boat, remaining completely detached.

The last day arrived. Although the situation seemed hopeless, Intetsu continued to fight. He searched for the slightest opportunity to change the course of the game, and a faint chance remained. For several hours, 74 more moves were made. Finally, there were no more options—Intetsu resigned. Jowa won the game. The players exchanged bows and started collecting the stones. Suddenly, Intetsu began to cough up blood directly on the board.

He expended all his energy on the game, leaving nothing for his own body. It was not destined for Intetsu to recover; he departed from life just over two months later, and his teacher sat by his bedside.

On a melancholic day, when I feel despondent and languid, I unfold the game of Intetsu. Powerless against the moves guided by spirits, the black stones lament just as they did in the hot summer of 1835.

THE ROAD TO GO

"The Game Coughing Blood" shook Wook. Before his eyes was the scene of Intetsu sitting motionless in a small boat. It was the first time Wook learned that a game could cost a life.

Wook found the game record on the back page and went through it. The game was swift, masterful. There were too many variations for Wook to understand them all. He felt like the stones were breathing with life, just as the story's author described.

Wook reviewed the game three times. Many moves were still unclear to him, and he decided to ask Nek about them at their next meeting—surely, he knew the answers.

Then Wook turned his attention to the game records of Master Wu. Reviewing one game took about two hours. There were also many incomprehensible moves here. Wook realized why Nek insisted on watching games ten times. Now Wook had truly become a "goof."

The two-week vacation came to an end, and the final year of school began. During the break, Wook couldn't meet Nek. Attempts to find Nek at the apartment he rented were in vain, and Nek himself never showed up at the "US." To Wook's surprise, Donga was also absent from the club; even Iku said he hadn't seen him for a long time.

The senior class at School K was unique. All efforts revolved around getting into the best university. Students, teachers, and parents had one common goal. Wook sympathized with classmates who studied intensively without understanding why. They had to study for 17 hours a day because that's what the people around them wanted, not themselves. Wook felt different—he was the only one in school who knew exactly what he would become in the future. Wook studied Master Wu's games more than mathematics or English. Naturally, his grades dropped.

Mr. Cheng, Wook's class teacher in the senior classes, scheduled a personal meeting with Wook. It was a few days after the first exam. Knowing Wook as one of the best students in the class, he was surprised by the poor grades. So, he called Wook.

"Wook, do you have any problems?"

"No, sir."

"I hope everything is okay with Mr. Kwon at work?"

"Yes, everything is fine."

"Hmm... Do you have a girlfriend?"

"No, sir."

Wook briefly thought about Inae. But knowing that she wasn't the one, he firmly said, "No."

Then why do you have such grades? - the angry headmaster demanded an answer.
"If you always just defend, you can't win." Wook decided to take the initiative.

Honestly, I dropped that thought—going to university.

Really!? Why? Do you have other plans for the future?

Yes, sir. I do. I can promise only one thing - I will finish school, but not with the intention of entering the university.

Amazing determination! Well, then, tell me about your plans.

Wook couldn't answer.

See! You don't even have a plan. Here's what I'll tell you. I'm sorry for pressing, but first, you should go to university while you have such an opportunity. Think about your family, brothers, and sisters. Do you want the traditions of the K family to end with you?

I doubt you can call it a tradition. Rather, it's stubbornness.

Of course, you think you're smarter than everyone. I assure you, you'll regret it later if you miss the chance to go to university now, "Z" University. You'll be a complete idiot if you don't understand this simple truth; unless, of course, you have some other specific plan!

I have a plan...

Tell me.

You can't tell me because you don't have one.

I do, sir, but...

Then tell me, please!

I want to become... a professional Go player.

What?! A Go player! Can you play?

Yes, a little.

What does "a little" mean?

First kyu...

I see! And you want to say that you'll participate in the qualification tournament?

Yes...

Good Lord!

Mr. Cheng was at a loss for words. He lit a cigarette, looking at Wook. Then he spoke again.

Listen to me. About ten years ago, working at school "R," I had a student who wanted to become a pro. He also had a first kyu - quite a rarity, as I understand. He left school to try himself in the qualification tournament. To this day, I browse through the lists of professionals to find his name. But his name is not there! But if he had finished school "R" before becoming a pro, he would have had a better future than after leaving this school. But... you're a different case. Refusing university for Go?! It's not right. From the students of the best school to professional players! Incomprehensible!

I shouldn't become a professional player just because I'm a student of the best school? In that case, if the best school is just an obstacle for the future, then it can't be called the best!

Wook's voice trembled. Mr. Cheng was struck by his student's logic. But it's hardly possible to argue with someone who has power over you.

Alright. Let's agree that I heard nothing. But I'll talk to your father if you don't improve your grades by the next exam. Okay?
Wook fell silent, hearing his father's name. Unlike Mr. Cheng, his father wouldn't listen to his son. So, Wook replied to promise to get better grades on the next exams.

But now, Wook couldn't prepare for exams; in ten days, he was supposed to participate in the first professional qualification tournament. Instead of mathematics and English, Wook studied Master Wu's games.

QUALIFYING TOURNAMENT

This tournament made many people cry. Twice a year, the top strong first kyus from the entire country, around three hundred people, gathered for this competition. Out of three hundred, only two left with a smile; the rest, deemed "crazy," were satisfied with tears. Their girlfriends, bar owners who became their regulars, and sometimes even their parents—all cried for their "abnormal failure." Perhaps it was a good thing that the Association held the tournament only twice a year, not more often.

Wook participated in the qualifying tournament for the first time. He felt guilty for lying to his father: three thousand won, supposedly for "textbooks," was spent on the tournament entry fee. Nevertheless, he eagerly awaited the start of the most prestigious Go tournament in the country. He had to sneak out of school and change clothes right in the bakery near the school. He left his uniform and school bag with the baker.

The huge tournament hall was packed. Dong was already there, but Nek was not in sight. Wook went to check the draw.

In the first stage, players were divided into groups of four each. The winners of the groups advanced to the second stage. In the groups, they played in a round-robin system. The same order applied to the second and third preliminary stages. After that, eight players remained, and two more joined based on the results of the previous tournament. Ten players, in total, would play in a round-robin system, with the top two becoming professionals, and two more advancing to the final of the next tournament.

Wook lost all three games in the first round. He completely failed two, and in the last one, he had a chance—he lost by only one and a half points. Wook was upset that he played so poorly, realizing how much more he had to do to become a pro. His dreams for the first stage evaporated. Three thousand won disappeared. But Wook quickly calmed himself, convincing himself that there was no other way at the moment. He felt a tremendous desire to improve.

Wook had no choice but to watch Dong's game. Dong had already won two games, and in the third, everything was going well for him. He had to advance to the second stage! Wook's mood improved; he left the Association building and went to change. The bakery owner, a middle-aged woman, looked at Wook sympathetically. Wook pretended not to notice her gaze and left the bakery with a bag full of clothes.

Positive for Wook in the defeat was that he didn't have to skip school tomorrow. Another absence could force Mr. Cheng to call his father. Luckily, there was no one at home to ask why he came home from school so early.

After a snack, Wook headed to the "YC" club. To his surprise, he met Nek, reading a newspaper alone.

"What happened, brother? Why haven't you come? I dropped by your place a few times. Why aren't you at the tournament?"

"Slow down, Wook. You must have participated in the tournament? Very good. One win and two losses? Or three barankis?" Nek, instead of answering, began asking questions.

"Yes, three losses. But why aren't you at the tournament?"

"I was third last time and automatically qualified for the final, did you forget?"

Nek smiled, as if reading Wook's thoughts. Wook was worried that Nek had given up everything. Wook felt relieved.

"How about coffee? Tell me about today's game."

Wook was disappointed that Nek wanted coffee instead of a game. But chatting with him was also a good idea. They walked to the "Lake."

There were few visitors in the "Lake," and they could sit longer without hints from the waitress.

After ordering coffee, Nek offered Wook a cigarette. Wook was surprised—it wasn't "Zmap" but "Svilada." Then Nek lit Wook's cigarette—another surprise—with a lighter.

It seemed Nek was satisfied with the effect.

"After our last meeting, I made good money. For your information, I smoked 'Zmap' not because I liked it but because I had no choice."

"You got a job? With only a month left until the army? How did you manage that?"

"You can't imagine what kind of job I have. I earn by playing Go."

"Teaching?"

"Who would pay for Go lessons? Bannegi!"

Bannegi is playing Go for money, where the amount won is determined by the handicap you win with. Wook was slightly disappointed. Nek, the best player he knew, was a gambler! His respect for Nek seemed to be melting away. Nek couldn't help but notice Wook's disappointment.

"Yeah, I understand. Bannegi is not the most righteous path. But understand a guy who has to fight for survival. I only know one thing—playing Go."

No education, no profession like others. I have to live somehow. I just had to resort to this. Then bannegi helps me not only survive in this world but also relieve the tension and pain I got from Go. Sometimes I tell myself: it's time to pay, Nek! I've spent everything on the Game, getting nothing in return. Bannegi is the only compensation. Why pretend?

Wook began to understand Nek better. Nek had indeed become a victim of his love for the Game and undoubtedly deserved reward. It was hard not to agree with that.

"But, brother Nek, you risk losing, there's no guaranteed victory, right?"

"A good player doesn't lose. I'll explain everything to you. But not today. I really don't want to talk about bannegi two days before the tournament. It's like visiting a prostitute two days before the wedding."

"Do you know how Dong is doing?"

"I think he at least made it to the second stage. When I left, he had already won two games and was doing well in the third."

"Fantastic. Dong might even become a pro this year. Riding on success can take you very high, even with someone as strong as Dong. Besides, he really prepared seriously for the tournament last month. Didn't you know?"

Wook now understood why he couldn't find Dong at the club—he was at home practicing all day. Wook remembered how nervous Dong got when the tournament was mentioned. It would be great if Dong and Nek became pros now! Wook sincerely wanted that.

BANNEGI

Dong made it to the final, winning nine games. He faced eight newcomers and two from the previous tournament. One of these two was Nek. For the next three days, ten players battled in a round-robin system for the title of pro.

Neither Nek nor Dong made it among the two lucky ones. Dong found some solace in his fourth place—now, in the next tournament, he wouldn't have to go through the preliminary qualification. Nek, who had high hopes for this tournament, played terribly. Now he had to start all over again in the next tournament, just like Wook, from the first stage.

"In any case, I'll be in the army and won't be able to participate in the tournament," Nek tried to joke, but Wook knew he was crying. The Game was too harsh on Nek. He wanted to end these relationships where his boundless love for the Game found no reciprocity.

"Can you come to the 'Road' teahouse near the tram stop tomorrow evening around eight? It would be nice if you spent the night with me. Can you arrange that?" Nek asked unexpectedly, and Wook didn't immediately know what to say but said he would try—he wanted to do something for Nek. Now he needed to come up with something plausible for his father.

Permission to study in the 24-hour library was obtained from his father very easily— he was surprised by his son's voluntary dedication to studies and even gave Wook money so he could have a snack.

The next day after lunch, Wook went to the library. There, he changed, hung his uniform jacket on the back of the chair—it was a precaution in case Mr. Kwon decided to check. Wook left the books open on the table and walked out of the library, rehearsing the possible scene: "You must have peeked when I was just going out for a snack." Wook was grateful for the dormitory curfew, which meant Mr. Kwon would return home before midnight. The whole scheme seemed risky, but Wook was ready to accept any punishment if his plan failed. It was quite possible that Nek's request to him was the last, and now Wook would do anything for him.

Nek was waiting for Wook at the 'Road'.

"Good you came. I wanted to show you this before going to the army... It's also part of the Game."

"What will you show me?" Wook asked.

"Bannegi," Nek grinned.
"Bannegi? Where?" Wook scanned the teahouse, as if trying to find people playing bannegi.

"I want you to watch me play today. I got permission from my opponent. So everything is settled."

"You'll be playing at the club?"

"No... It's impossible to play high stakes at the club. We'll be playing at the 'Seven Stars' motel across the street from here."

Wook felt uneasy. He had never been to a motel, and the prospect frightened him. What if the police came?

Unaware of Wook's concern, Nek explained the rules:

"Bann equals ten points of territory. So winning from 1 to 10 points is one bann, from 11 to 20 - two banns, and so on.

Usually, the number of banns is limited to ten, in other words, manbann. Thus, the smallest number of points that will give you manbann is 91. Even if you win with a much larger margin, say three hundred points, it's still just manbann.

Before the game begins, both sides agree on the cost of each bann and the main stake. The main stake is the money that the winner will get in any case, regardless of the advantage. When they make a bet, it is divided into two parts: first, the main stake, and then the bann's price. For example, 'one hundred, twenty' means that the main stake is 100 won, and each bann costs 20 won. A bit of practice, if I win the game '100, 20' with 12 points, how much will I get? 140 won. You can only surrender when you realize you've lost manbann.

"Now - the most important thing in bannegi - before the game starts, both sides are obliged to put under the board an amount equal to manbann. This prevents the losing player from continuing the game after running out of money. Thus, if a player's pockets are empty and he has to reach under the board, bannegi ends.

"What are the stakes today?"

"Five thousand. One thousand."

"A five-thousand won bank and a thousand for each bann? Then manbann should be fifteen thousand!"

Wook's surprise was natural; the starting salary for a university graduate in a major firm was approximately 30 thousand won per month. Wook felt really out of place. He remembered newspaper articles about raids on participants in gambling, with photos of players and confiscated money. Looking at the concerned Wook, Nek smiled.

"Relax. The local sergeant often drops by there to win money for cigarettes. Besides, friends will be there today."

Wook was somewhat reassured, but some doubts still lingered.

"What if you lose, Brother Nek?"

"I won't lose," Nek's voice sounded confident.

"I know you play well, Nek. But anyone can lose, regardless of strength. Besides, the guy playing against you must think he has a chance. Why else would he agree to such high stakes?"

"Exactly. That's why, in the last five months, I've taken some preparatory measures."

"What measures?"

Nek looked around, checking if anyone could eavesdrop.

"He couldn't beat me even with a seven-stone handicap! Five months ago, I started a small bannegi with him, ten won per bann with a four-stone handicap. At the beginning, we agreed that the handicap would change accordingly if one of us won three games in a row. I controlled wins and losses so that the handicap fluctuated between three and four stones. Now he's convinced he can easily beat me with four stones and has a chance with three."

A few days ago, when we were drinking soju together, he finally asked me the question I had been patiently waiting for five months. He asked what handicap I could give him, considering my fantastic skill. I gave him the answer I had prepared five months ago — six stones. As expected, this answer upset him: "Six? You've never gone beyond four, and now you're talking about six? Look at things realistically! No one can beat me with six stones. If you're so good to say six, how about we play bannegi 5000, 1000? Scared? Ha-ha-ha... Then don't mention six again."

I replied, "Why not play?" At first, he was surprised that I accepted these conditions, but then he calculated — and here his logic played a wicked trick on him — that I accepted the challenge because of my inflated self-esteem. Oh, how I enjoyed his smug face in anticipation of easy money, ha-ha-ha-ha. So the bannegi I had planned became a reality. His vanity and self-deception led him into a trap. I never tire of reveling in the stupid pride of weak players for their foolish game. Well, how can I lose to such a self-absorbed guy?

Hmm... But that's fraud, don't you think, brother?

It very well might be. But I don't feel guilty. This guy deserves a little punishment. All his money he gained through luck in the stock market. He looks down on the poor, his rudeness and arrogance are sickening. Once, I saw him waving a five-hundred won bill in front of a beggar's nose, never giving it to him. Inhumane. He must pay with what he values most — money!

"By the way, how much money do you have with you, Brother Nek?"

"About fifty thousand. It's a necessary minimum, considering possible strategic losses."

"Strategic losses?"

"Yes. If I beat him right from the start, he'll accuse me of cheating and might not even pay. It's better to let the opponent win one or two banns to inflate his confidence. Then, in the third or fourth game, you strike with 7-8 banns. He loses composure, eager to quickly win back the money. And once he loses his head, you systematically and ruthlessly drain him until he runs out of money. Today's evening has one inexcusable mistake - he won't have a large sum with him, at most 50-60 thousand, as he doesn't suspect he might lose. If we were to arrange another match, I could take much more. But it's risky - he might catch on. Well, let's go. It's time."

Wook followed him. Nek's silhouette seemed frighteningly massive. A formidable man who wanted to achieve revenge in his own way. Intimidating but deserving respect. At least for the patience displayed in these five months of pretense and calculation, thought Wook.

At the motel, their opponent awaited them. Boss Park, along with the owner of the Go club, who would be the judge tonight; both were well over forty. The meeting place turned out to be a medium-sized room with a double bed in the corner. Contrary to Wook's expectations, the room was neatly and cleanly arranged.

After exchanging handshakes, Nek, laying out 15 thousand under the board, remarked:

"I was probably out of my mind when I agreed to play with you. Boss Park, this is bannegi at six stones."

"Agreement is worth more than money today - six it is, ha-ha-ha-ha!" Boss Park was excited about the prospect of easy money. As soon as Boss Park placed the required amount, the judge announced the start of the first game.

Nek lost the first game by 30 points - two banns. The second - by 7 points - one bann. The defeats were expected, but Wook knew it was all part of Nek's plan. As promised by Nek, he won the third game by five banns.

"I was a bit careless... if not for this ko fight at the end, I would have won again..." Boss Park, unaware that Nek's plan was unfolding, regretted the initial loss, and his voice still sounded quite confident.

Nek acted cautiously not to sober him up.

"A bit of luck is all I need to beat you at six stones."

"Sorry, but that won't happen again," Boss Park said, setting six stones on the board. It seemed he wanted to win a new victory quickly to forget this annoying loss. Losing at six stones was an insulting blow for him. But real blows followed later.

Boss Park lost the next five games, each by six or seven banns. Finally, on the sixth, a manban was reached. Counting the money to settle for the loss, Boss Park discovered his pockets were empty! He was visibly upset that he couldn't continue the game and pleaded with Nek:

"I'll pay everything as soon as the bank opens. Please, let me play one more game!"

Nek, perhaps even more upset that he couldn't win more, was unyielding:

"Sir, you know better than me. We could continue tomorrow, but for now - no more games!"

The judge, realizing it was time to intervene, announced the end of the game for the day.

"Alright, I'll be waiting for you at the club exactly at 8 o'clock!" shouted Boss Park, rushing out of the room and slamming the door. Nek smiled contentedly. He counted out five thousand won and handed it to the judge.

"Thank you for your participation, until evening."

"Nek, I KNOW... Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't come to the club tonight. He's punished enough."

"Alright. I don't plan to show up anywhere."

The judge left, thanking for the generous tip. Wook and Nek looked at each other for the first time in a long while. Wook could only say:

"Wow!"

"Yes, about 60 thousand. Nek was attentive to every detail, even the winnings for the night.

"That's awesome! It's only five in the morning? Let's sleep now and then have a good breakfast together. Okay, Wook?"

Wook agreed too. He was delighted with the proposal. Observing the game exhausted him almost as much as the players themselves.

Nek summoned a boy from the staff and, paying for the room, whispered something to him. The boy gave a deep bow and left. Soon after, Alpaco, the boy, returned and escorted them to the floor above to their rooms. Wook realized, with surprise, that Nek had paid for two separate rooms. Although later he thought that it might not be very convenient to sleep in the same room.

You must be hungry too, Wook? They will bring pies and soju soon. Will you sleep better after that? Good night.
— How about having a drink together?

Nеk, as if not hearing the question, went to his room. Soon Wook understood why.

About ten minutes later, there was a knock on the door. It was a girl with a thick layer of makeup on her face, holding a tray with food and soju. Nok ordered girls for both of them - that's what the separate rooms were for.

Wook found himself in an awkward situation: he had no sexual experience. This is too much, he thought. He still had a faint hope that the girl would just deliver the food and leave. However, after setting the table with soju and food in front of Wook, she sat down nearby as if nothing had happened.

Did you play Go? You must be terribly tired, sir. Then you shouldn't drink too much.

The girl, who appeared to be 4-5 years older than Wook, spoke to him very softly and politely meanwhile pouring soju into a glass. Wook drank it in one gulp and spoke with a hoarse voice:

Uh... Will you have some?
She looked at Wook, smiling gently. Then she poured herself some and took a small sip.

— Have a bit to eat, sir. It's not good to drink soda on an empty stomach.

Taking a mattress and a blanket from the cupboard, she unfolded them and carefully laid them in the center of the room. Turning off the overhead light, she turned on a pink nightlight and began pouring without a shadow of doubt. For her, it seemed like all of this was routine. But Wook couldn't watch it calmly. He filled a glass and drank.

— Please, you need to relax. - whispered the girl. She was completely undressed.

Alright, now... Maybe...

She seemed not to notice his confusion.

_ Sir, maybe it would be better if I undress you?

Wook jumped at the unexpected offer and started undressing himself, mentally grateful for the dim light of the nightlight hiding his embarrassment. Remaining in underwear, he cautiously took hold of the edge of the blanket, trying to lie as far away from the girl as possible. However, with a gentle movement, she drew him closer, helping him remove the remaining clothes. Wook's timid attempts to resist were overcome by her tender hands.

LOSS OF FRIENDS

"Wook, forgive me, please, if yesterday's actions offended you. I wanted to do something for you, and this is the only thing I can offer to a friend... so, please, try to understand. Juna is a wonderful girl, a rare find in such places. If you liked her, visit her someday — she'll appreciate it.

The bills are covered. Don't pay anything more. I have to go home to join the army. By the time you read this letter, I'll already be gone.

Also, don't be upset, please... I left you some money from yesterday's winnings. I just wanted to give you a little, that's all. Besides, believe me, your presence helped me. And I won't need the money in the army anyway.

It's quite possible that we'll never see each other again, but for some reason, I believe that we'll meet again somehow, because we both play. I want to remain your teacher, even though we only played once. Take care of 'Wook's Game Records.' I'm sure you'll become stronger than me. NEK."

Nek left, saying his own goodbye. In the envelope that Juna gave him in the morning, along with the letter, there were forty-five thousand won. Wook had never had such an amount in his life. He handed Juna ten five-hundred won bills.

_ No-no. Your friend already paid me more than enough... besides, this is too much too.

Please, take it, for my sake.
Wook felt great, seeing that his first woman was grateful and happy. Perhaps he would visit her again soon.

It was around ten in the morning when Wook took a taxi to the library. He appreciated how comfortable it was to have a lot of money in his pocket. He sighed with relief: the officer didn't come for inspection. He changed into his uniform and took a taxi home. Wook felt immense fatigue at home and went straight to bed.

Lying with closed eyes, he saw Juna naked. Wook tried to get up. In place of Juna, Inae appeared — she was also undressed. Guilt drove away sleep. Then the image of Nek in the taxi on the way home came to him. Private Nok — what an inappropriate way to address him! Nek was Wook's teacher, his only teacher! Wook's Game Records... Wook fell into a deep sleep and slept through the late evening, after which he headed to the US Club. Dong was there.

"Hello, Dong. Congratulations on reaching the finals of the next tournament.

Let's have a drink, my treat.

Dong wasn't too cheerful. It would be interesting to know why - reaching the final was indeed a big success. Dong walked with Wook, not noticing his surprise. After they finished a bottle of soda, Dong slowly began to speak:

Wook, for some time, we won't be able to meet...
First Nek, now Dong. What could it be? It's too early for the army.

I took the tournament very seriously. Perhaps that's why I made it to the finals. And suddenly, I became a sort of local celebrity, attracting flies...
— Flies?

— Yes, in a way. After the tournament, a wealthy man spoke to me. He said he wants to help me. You know how?

— He offered to continue my education, paying for a scholarship.

_ Is that bad? Why the sadness?

— He's going to send me for the first year of high school. I understand, I was expelled from the first year, but my classmates will already graduate this spring. And I have to put on the school uniform again. The second time in the first grade... It's too much.

There's a huge difference between a high school graduate and a regular student. Until graduation, there are strict restrictions for students, and only after high school are people treated as adults. Wook understood Dong's situation perfectly.

Well, if you're going to start studying from the beginning, why do you need his help?
_ I need it. I left school because I couldn't afford it... This scholarship will solve my financial problems. I will participate in tournaments among high school students.

I won't be able to go out at all until I finish school. I'll stay at home and study. And I won't see anyone, including you.

— Well, if that's the case... I still think it's too much - to detach yourself so much. Let's at least stay in touch somehow, maybe by phone.

Dong didn't answer - he disagreed. Wook knew how stubborn Dong could be and didn't try to persuade him. Perhaps he'll change his mind soon.

— I'm sorry, Wook. It's tough for me too... But please try to understand. By the way, did you know, Ik went to work in Dongluchui, at the American military base?"

"Even Ik too?! Wook was overwhelmed and saddened.

Since that day, Dong didn't show up at the club. The story about Ik turned out to be true. Wook couldn't understand how someone could disappear without even saying goodbye. He also stopped going to the club. What was there to do if there were no Dong, no Nek, and now no Ik? At home, Wook studied Master Vu's games. It took him six months to review all 300 games and then some. He needed to go through them nine more times, without the help of Nek or Dong. He decided to go his own way. Wook was firmly sure he wouldn't go to college. Becoming a professional player was his only goal.

It was good that Inae remained by his side. She encouraged Wook, who was on the verge of depression due to the loss of friends. Occasionally, Wook would visit her, mostly to help with math and English. He felt a significant difference between their schools. The challenging problems of the third year for her were easily solved by Wook in his first year at his school. As a volleyball player, she could enter university without entrance exams, but Mr. Park insisted on exams. Inae told Wook that in America, all athletes take exams.

Inae didn't understand why Wook, who also taught her, didn't want to go to college. But she never questioned him about it. Wook assumed that such delicacy had developed in her under the influence of her father.

Despite Inae's presence, Wook often felt lonely, especially because of Nok. The book of Wook's game records and the money left by Nek gave Wook a constant feeling of his presence. Wook visited Juna twice: she somehow reminded him of Nek, at least that's how Wook explained it to himself. He still had over ten thousand won, and Wook hadn't figured out how to spend it yet. Time passed, and in two months, Wook was supposed to graduate from school - it was already December."

SEOUL CLUB

The last winter holidays before graduation had arrived. Wook walked slowly from school to home. On a pole, he saw a handwritten notice: "New Seoul Go Club Opened." The poster, made by an enthusiast, included a rough map showing the location of the club. Wook had a free evening and decided to check it out.

Probably because the club had just opened today, no one was playing in it yet. Wook was warmly greeted by a middle-aged woman in traditional Korean clothing, heavily adorned with makeup. Despite the excess of paint on her face, an aura of elegance surrounded her.

— Please come in. Oh! K-school student! We don't have any players yet; we opened just two hours ago. Would you like some coffee? Come this way. What rank do you play?

— 1st kyu...

— Really? I heard 1st kyu is quite a high rank.

It was clear that she wasn't well-informed about the game. Wook thought that she might be better off in a different business, perhaps opening a teahouse.

— Where do you live? District K? Quite far from here. But I hope you can come more often. I heard that 1st kyu doesn't have to pay an entrance fee; is that correct?

She seemed to be familiar with the basic rules of Go clubs. Wook liked her soft voice and friendly attitude. It was just the perfect place for Wook to play his games. In any case, there were no more partners for him in the US Club, and Mr. Kwon openly expressed his dissatisfaction with Wook playing Go at home.

— Don't you know how to play, ma'am?

_ Not at all. What's wrong with that?

Then why did you choose the Go club?
— I used to be in the "wave" business. But I had to deal with so many dirty and dishonest people that, in the end, it became tiresome. I decided to engage in something more high-class.

"High class?" Wook recalled only Bass Park when he was thrown out of the motel room. Although if she referred to the "wave business" as managing a bar or something similar, Wook was ready to agree. At some point, Wook pondered on how to address her: it was not appropriate to call elders by their name. Something like "uncle," "teacher," etc., seemed more suitable, but even just "owner" didn't quite fit. After some thought, Wook decided to address her as "Madam Hostess."

Yes, today is the first day of winter vacation, and I can come often.
_ Great! Please come! — Madam Hostess looked very pleased.

However, Wook managed to repeat his visit to the club only two weeks later. Overcoming the 20-minute walk didn't appeal to him. But remembering the happy face of the hostess expecting him, he overcame his laziness with sheer willpower.

Like two weeks ago, the Seoul club was empty, except for a couple of players in the corner. Drastic changes had occurred in the hostess herself. Joyful and welcoming during the opening, she was now in tears. Lost in such an unexpected situation, Wook quietly moved to an available seat near the door. What had happened, he wondered, maybe someone had offended her? She noticed Wook and, brightening up, approached him:

— Welcome. Please have some tea.

She tried to calm down, but in vain. Wook was forced to ask,

— Something happened, ma'am? You're completely different...

— You'd be different too. Something happened today... I thought all Go players were gentlemen. It seems not! Have you been to the M1 club across the street? No? Shortly before you, two young men from that club came in here slightly intoxicated. So, these two demanded an explanation as to why no one informed them about the club opening. Who is obligated to inform them, anyway? Then they asked if we have a Club Master. When they found out we didn't, they laughed and said that, in that case, we're not a club. When I told them that our club is just as good, if not better, than theirs, they just laughed and demanded that I prove it. In short, they challenged our club to a match, adding that if none of ours can beat them, it would prove our club's incompetence. They promised to be back at nine.

At first, I wanted to call the police - it's extortion! But upon careful consideration, this might be their strategy to discredit the club in the eyes of others. They could spread jokes later about how low-class our club is compared to theirs.

But what truly upset me was their attitude. Why were they behaving so arrogantly? Why ceremonize with a woman who runs a business alone! That upsets me the most.

Tears welled up in her eyes again.

Mom, can I accept their challenge?
Dad, can you? Can you beat those scoundrels? Honestly, I was afraid of losing new customers who would come here to learn.

Wook felt a sense of pride like a knight in shining armor who had to battle Gilbert, a notorious villain, for the life of a Jewish girl. Wook left the club, promising to return by nine. It was only half-past eight, and he pondered on what to do for the rest of the evening. Why not visit Inae?

She was at home and delighted with the unexpected visit.

— Hi, Wook. Come in. I'm so bored sitting alone to death. Dad is at work, and mom went shopping.

Inae claimed to love Château novels, and her bookshelves were filled with books of all kinds. Before Go, Wook was also a voracious reader. Once he even decided to read all the books in the school library. Although the plan didn't succeed, he managed to read half the library in two years. Now Inae was reading "Demian" by Hermann Hesse. Hesse, wow! Wook was impressed.

_ I like the part where the bird flies over Abraxas. I wonder what he's like, this Abraxas.

No, Hesse was beyond Inae's reach, Wook thought.

I think Abraxas is an abstract concept. Everything could be him: heaven, hell, university, marriage, bar, or even a dog kennel. In this case, the inevitability of the bird hatching from the shell is much more important.
Wook's pun, clearly without a hint, left Inae completely bewildered. Wook was pleased with her confusion, but soon felt guilty - he had to save the situation urgently.

— Want to take a walk to Dukso Palace?

Inae agreed.

They walked along the path to Dukso Palace in the 1st district. Inae's cream-colored coat sat perfectly on her tall and slender figure. Wook felt awkward when he was with her in school uniform in public. He reached for her hand - it was warm and friendly.

Wook! How great to run into you! — Suddenly a loud voice with a northern accent echoed. It was Cheng, his homeroom teacher. Wook was taken aback: what luck, just fantastic, to bump into Cheng when he had no left ear for some time!

Wook, we need to talk. — The teacher's voice lost its northern accent. Wook asked Inae to go ahead, but Cheng wouldn't let him do that: "No-no, both of you come with me."

Wook understood what his teacher wanted. According to school rules, if caught dating without a left ear, Wook could face suspension. But Cheng seemed not to follow that rule. The "Two Arrested" students were led to the bakery.

Having ordered a few delicious buns and some milk for Wook and Inae, Mr. Cheng lit a cigarette. He looked at Inae and asked,

Which school do you attend?
Realizing that this was Wook's teacher, Inae lost her ability to speak. Wook tried to reassure her, making secret signals, but her big eyes froze in fear.

— She goes to School S, sir. - Wook had to help her.

It seemed the teacher was interested in this strange alliance between two students from such different schools.

Are you two already acquainted?
Wook couldn't hide his nervousness. What was all this about? But Cheng surprised the kids even more.

— Well, I must be going. Enjoy the buns. I always wanted to buy you a bun, Wook.

Mr. Cheng, approaching the cashier, paid for the order. And he left the bakery without even turning around. Wook was simply stunned by the teacher's actions; he couldn't explain his mysterious behavior. Among students, there were rumors that Cheng was an active member of the Northwest Youth Organization, known for its bold and dangerous fight against North Korean communists during the war. But even if these rumors were true, the teacher's current behavior was still remarkable.

Inae's face lit up; she enjoyed the buns, regretting that their school didn't have such a wonderful teacher. Wook also felt relieved along with a sense of unease due to the unexpected events of the day.

They abandoned the idea of going to Dukso Palace and returned home. Inae's mom had already come back from the store.

— Glad to see you, Wook. Come in, please. Let's have lunch together. You've heard Inae's complaint that you rarely visit, depriving him of the opportunity to play.

— Thanks, I can't today...

— Mom, ask him if he's not coming because of a date.

_ No, Inae. I have a tournament at seven. I'll call tomorrow, I promise.

Wook had to tell a little lie to the disappointed Inae. He didn't need to rush to the Seoul club. But he needed time to rest and prepare. He had about an hour left.

Lunch in a Korean restaurant near the club.

Obelisk in a Korean restaurant near the club, Wook began to regret that he got involved in a complicated story due to his naive knightly sense. He remembered many strong players whom he had seen facing the wind in the club. Anyway, there was no way to change it now, and the club owner had no other player.

Wook arrived at the club by eight, where the hostess awaited him eagerly. When he sat down to drink coffee, two men in their thirties entered. Wook immediately felt that it was them. One of the men approached the hostess, grinning.

_ How are you, ma'am? This morning, we were just joking. Forgive us if we offended you. Why don't you hire us as club masters? We won't ask for much. We guarantee good publicity for your club.

The hostess pounced on them:

— There's no need for that! I already hired a club master, here he is, - she pointed at Wook. They were surprised by this turn of events, but seeing the child in school uniform, they started grinning again.

— Oh, you're the Master, sir? Don't you want to teach us the game?

Wook answered gently:

— It's too late now. Can I play with one of you?

These two seemed surprised that the "kid" didn't back down but accepted the challenge. They moved to a corner, whispering, deciding who would give the lesson. They chose the guy who had been talking to the hostess. They and Wook sat down at the board and drew lots. Wook ended up playing with white. After exchanging bows, the game began.

Five or six spectators gathered around the table, watching with interest.

After a while, Wook realized with immense relief that his opponent was playing at a simple first kyu level. Perhaps he could have given him a two-stone handicap. As Wook had anticipated, the game proceeded quite quickly. A massive group of black stones died without much struggle. After this, the two very embarrassed losers hastily retreated.

Oh, my! Dates and rules are so powerful! Thank you so much, Wook. How can I repay you? Too bad you're underage; I would have treated you to something better.

_ Don't worry, ma'am. They asked for trouble themselves. It turned out for the best. I'm just happy to be a part of it.

Wook tried to speak like an adult. He was a bit upset that they considered him underage. Nevertheless, despite that, he felt great: justice prevailed, and he played a role in it! Justice achieved through Go. He truly felt very good.

"Come, please, more often, whenever you can. Starting from today, I accept you as the Master of the club. Of course, I will pay you for your work, but my gratitude to you is much higher."

Wook left the club as a hero. The hostess walked him to the street and kept repeating words of gratitude tirelessly. The Seoul club became Wook's new haven. It was much cleaner and more pleasant than the U.S., where gambling was taking place in the back room. Moreover, he would be a respected club master with the full support of a kind and pleasant hostess.

Throughout the journey home, Wook was in high spirits. Here he would be able to share splendid news with Inae tomorrow. However, The surprises did not end there.

FUGITIVE

At Wook's home, a shocking sight awaited him. A gap loomed on his bookshelf, missing an entire section of books. The gap resembled a huge mouth, laughing at him. He couldn't understand what had happened, and a heavy feeling enveloped him.

"Father is calling you," his mother entered the room. There was no usual warm and loving smile on her face.

"Today, your father met with our teacher, Mr. Cheng. When he returned from school, he gathered all your Go books and burned them. He chopped the board into pieces. I've never seen him like this. It's better for you to go and apologize right now. Ask for his forgiveness. Is it true that you told the teacher you plan to become a Go player and won't go to university?"

Now Wook knew how things stood. The mysterious behavior of Cheng was explained. He probably wanted to talk to Wook about the meeting with his father but changed his mind when he saw Inae's frightened eyes.

Wook checked the bookshelf. 'Records of Wook's Games' were gone. Only the book of poems survived the storm of that day. It was a massive, cruel injustice.

A thunderous voice echoed from afar. Wook made a decision. He quickly put the book of poems and some clothes into his bag. What else? In his memories, he remembered the money he borrowed from Nek; it remained untouched. Wook rushed out of the house and ran until he felt safe. It seemed like his father was right behind him in the darkness. Wook stopped and looked around. No, it seemed like an illusion. Mr. Kwon wasn't there. But he ran again.

Soon he found himself on a busy street. Where to go? Wook thought in desperation. To the US? No, his father would go there first. It was already 7 p.m., and the curfew started at 12. He urgently needed to find a place. Jun's motel? No, he had to think of something better - Wook was in his school uniform with a bag. Maybe Bu, his older brother? Yes, he could go there. Wook caught the last bus to the K district. It was 23:25, and Bu's place was only a 15-minute ride.

"Yes, sir. He's here with me. I'll calm him down and bring him back. Of course, sir. Don't worry, sir. I'll do that, too."

Bu had just reported to his father about Wook's whereabouts and received precise instructions on what to do with the runaway. He looked at Wook with a smile. The eldest son in the family, 13 years older than Wook, stood out among the other brothers and sisters."

He could have been Wook's uncle. Previously, he helped him solve problems without his father's knowledge. He was a vibrant person, ambitious yet devoid of vanity and inflated pride. Many people liked him. Bu first sent his curious wife out of the room before speaking with a gentle smile.

"Well, the troublemaker, is it true that you're planning to devote your life to Go?

You don't really know father; consider yourself lucky. If he were younger... It's very sad that he's too old now to raise you in the way he used to - sometimes he could be stubborn, but he was a great man. I want you to play, despite everything.

"Okay, what's your rank?"

"First kyu..."

"When did you learn to play so well?! Shall we play? I'm sixth kyu. How many handicap stones? Six? Seven?"

Bu was already about to set up the board. Despite his promise to his father, he acted as an accomplice.

"Brother, I'm not in the mood to play."

"All right..." He probably smashed the board into small pieces.

"And the books too. Among them was one that you won't find anywhere in the country."

"Don't worry. I'll find a copy, whatever it was. It's silly for a man to be upset about such a trifle."

"I doubt you'll find a copy of this book. It was a Japanese edition, very old."

"Japanese? Seems like you're seriously considering becoming a professional player. I have a friend who wants to become a pro too. He also studies Japanese books."

"Do you really want to become a Go player? Instead of going to university?"

"I want to give it a try."

"If you're serious, I can talk to father. I don't think getting into university is the only right path, especially if you have such a serious intention to become a player... It might be difficult to convince father."

"Difficult? Wook didn't think so - it was simply impossible! Wook was sure that Bu knows it well too."

"Why don't you compromise, even just a little? Try taking entrance exams, even if you're sure you won't get in. Do it for the sake of our father."

That would be hypocrisy, brother.

"Hypocrisy? You still have much to learn - in life, there are situations where hypocrisy is unavoidable.

If you don't want to go back home, you can stay with me for as long as you want. Father asked to bring you tomorrow, but I can convince him otherwise. If I say I'll personally monitor your studies, he'll allow it. Well, go to sleep now. I have work early tomorrow."

Wook went to the room prepared by Bu's wife and fell asleep with thoughts about the future: he understood that he would soon have to leave this house. Despite Bu's bold assurances, he would take him to his father at the first demand. Bu never did anything contrary to his father's wishes.

Late at night, there was a knock on the door - it was Bu with a bottle of wine.

"Aren't you sleeping? I thought so."

"You have work in the morning, don't you?"

"Yes, but it's not that late yet. I rarely go to bed before midnight. Come on, let's have a drink. Just don't say you've never drunk before reaching the first kyu."

The brothers emptied their glasses together. Wook was grateful to Bu for the warning. He wanted to tell his brother everything. Tell about Inae? No, Bu would just smile in response... But Bu started talking about something else.

"Do you know anything about the board chopped today?"

"And what's so special about it?"

The board had been in the house as long as Wook could remember himself. He often used it when studying. Sometimes it could come in handy for plates with fruits or cookies. Wook was the first to use the board for its direct purpose. Even Bu, claiming to be sixth kyu, never played at home.

"It's our great-grandfather's board."

"Great-grandfather? Did he know how to play?"

"Not only did he know, but he was one of the best players in the country."

How is his name written?

Out of respect, it's not common to ask about the father's name, let alone the great-grandfather's, so they ask to write it without mentioning.

"In Go terms, his name had the characters 'Byeong' and 'Wook'. Grandpa gave you the name in honor of him."

"I was already falling asleep when the thought struck me that it was his wish for you to play Go, not to go to university."

"Wow..."

"Grandpa had a difficult childhood because of his father playing Go. So, he didn't even come close to the board. Of course, all this also influenced our father - he never learned to play."

"Now I understand a bit the father's hatred for the game."

— A captivating story, isn't it? Love for Go revived itself through three generations... Grandma once told me that Grandpa died because of Go. I don't know the exact reason - she didn't say anything more, and now she's already gone. If you happen to learn something about Grandpa, don't forget to tell me. I really want to know more about him now.

Bu returned to his room, and Wook lay in bed thinking. Something became clear. Now that strange feeling he experienced when he first saw the game was explained. Wook was sure - it was HIM, his great-grandfather, looking down at him. Wook wanted to learn more about his great-grandfather now. He could look for something in the State Library. Suddenly, Wook remembered Ineta from "The Game of Coughing Blood." Maybe the great-grandfather also died, coughing blood? Wook couldn't sleep until morning.

Wook fell asleep at dawn and woke up only around noon. Bu had already gone to work.

When Wook emerged from the bathroom, Bu's wife was feeding the baby. She released the child into the playpen and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Wook stopped her:

— Don't worry, please, I don't want to eat. I need to go.

— What? What will my brother say? I won't let you leave without breakfast. Please, wait. It will be very quick.

— No, really, I need to go. Please, feed the baby.

Wook almost rushed out of the house, leaving his relative upset. He needed to hurry before his father came. He was mistaken - his father was at home, fully convinced that Bu would bring Wook in the evening.

Wook took a bus to a district with many second-hand bookstores on one of the streets. He hoped to find "Wook's Game Records." Although he wasn't sure if his search would be successful.

The book needed to become a professional Go player must be found at any cost. For over four hours, Wook unsuccessfully visited all the stores one by one, determined not to leave until he found what he needed. And he found it! After persistent pleading, the owner of one of the shops sneaked into the warehouse, where he found "Records." Wook literally snatched the book from the hands of the bookseller - it was even more battered than Nek's book. The cunning shopkeeper scolded Wook thoroughly, but he didn't care.

Wook felt relieved. Only now did he feel hunger - there were no crumbs in his mouth since last night. While eating tasteless noodles in a nearby Chinese cafe, he contemplated where to spend the night. There wasn't much choice. Bu's house was immediately excluded: his father wouldn't let him slip away a second time. Wook briefly considered meeting his father face to face, as men do. The idea was useless, and Wook immediately dismissed it. Attempting to convince his father was akin to trying to break a rock by throwing eggs at it. He could try going to the 24-hour library if there were no other options, but for now, he needed to pass the time. He thought about Inae, but quickly dismissed the idea. He would have to tell about the events of the night and the real state of affairs. Once he decided that the next stop would be the Seoul Go Club - there, he could play a game or watch Wook's matches.

"Welcome, Wook. Did you have breakfast? Would you like some coffee?"

As expected, the club owner greeted him warmly. One of the club's regulars, a man in his fifties, unable to find a partner, was about to leave.

Wook willingly offered his services, as if he were indeed the club's master. They played three games with a five-stone handicap. Wook carefully commented on each game. His partner was impressed with the variations Wook showed. He left, promising to return. The hostess was also very pleased with Wook's efforts.

"He was dissatisfied with the lack of partners. How timely you came! Can you come every day? Play with regular customers or just keep me company. I've already talked about payment."

"I'll come often, I promise. But I won't take any money - I would feel terrible if I took money."

"Okay, okay. We'll discuss the money later. By the way, what's wrong with you today - you're terribly sad!"

"No, nothing..."

"Let's do it this way, Wook. I've been in the water business for over ten years and I can feel the mood! Did you break up with your girlfriend? Or problems with your parents?"

It must be interesting to be in this water business if you can determine someone else's state of mind so quickly and accurately. Wook decided to tell everything. She listened without interrupting, refraining from comments even when Wook couldn't contain his emotions about the injustice of the forced demand to uphold the traditions of the KZ family. She sat calmly, allowing the fugitive to tell his entire drama. When Wook finished, she spoke slowly:

"Where are you going to spend the night tonight? At your brother's?"

"No... I can go to the 24-hour library or to a friend. But not to my brother's... Whatever happens, I won't go back for now. Both my father and I need time to cool off."

"I thought so. Then, will you stay with me? I have a three-room apartment. You can stay for a few days without any problems. What do you say, Wook?"

Wook hesitated. It was hard to refuse such an offer, but he didn't want to burden the hostess. Wook timidly objected:

"We don't even know each other properly."

"Don't think about it. I don't know how to thank you for yesterday evening. Give me the opportunity to repay you. No more discussions on this topic, okay?"

Wook nodded slowly. In any case, it was only for a few days. It would be foolish to sleep on a bench in the library when there was a warm room available, Wook reasoned. Wook stayed at the club until closing. Around 11 PM, the hostess closed the club, and they took a taxi to the O district.

In the car, Wook was silent. Quite naturally, an 18-year-old young man felt uncomfortable on the way to an unfamiliar place. The hostess understood this and remained silent too. Wook thought of Bu; at this very moment, his father must be going to Bu's place for him. "Forgive me, brother. I have no choice," Wook whispered to himself.

In the apartment, located on the third floor of a four-story building, the hostess immediately went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. Wook, sitting on a stool, looked through the newspapers.

"Wook, don't worry! Your father will cool off in a few days, I'm sure of it. Sleep, I'll leave early for work tomorrow morning. Watch TV or just relax. Rest, and you'll feel better. I'll leave spare keys to the apartment; come and go as you please. You can stay here as long as you want; you don't bother me at all. Think of me as an older sister or aunt, okay?"

Appreciating her kind gesture, Wook was confident that he would stay here only for a short time. He considered it impolite to stay longer than a few days, or else he would have to pay the landlady.

The pork cutlets were very tasty. Wook thanked her and went to his room. Exhaustion hit him, and he fell asleep as soon as he lay down.

THE SECOND TEACHER

The landlady had already left when Wook woke up. She even prepared breakfast for him. It was around noon. He had breakfast and started to contemplate what to do. There was nowhere to go. He could stay and rest, as the landlady suggested. In three days, school would start, and by that time, he had to make decisions.

Wook opened the book he acquired after all those adventures. He intended to review several games, but he found out that there was no goban in the house. The owner of the Go club didn't have a set for the game — was it irony?! She certainly didn't seem fit to be the owner of the Go club. But what difference did it make to Wook? She was one of the few people who supported him in a difficult time.

Moreover, Wook thought that he didn't even have a toothbrush. Finding keys in his pocket, he decided to go to the store.

The apartment was on a hill. Wook went down to the nearest corner store. Buying a board and stones, Wook felt relative comfort. The game strangely calmed him.

Returning to the apartment, he began to study the games. He watched the games of Master Wu in the second round. Many moves were inexplicable. If Nok were nearby, he could probably help figure it out, although Nek said that he himself didn't understand much. Wook tried to calculate difficult moves independently. Compared to Go, school subjects like mathematics or English were straightforward to learn — there were clear questions and clear answers.

Solving complex and tedious problems of the Master, Wook felt drowsy. He dozed off right on the couch, then moved to his room, laid down on the bed, and fell asleep. The accumulated fatigue and worries of the last two days became the best sedative for him.

Wook opened his eyes in surprise - he was completely naked. And not only
He. The naked hostess lay nearby.

- You. must have fallen asleep while studying the book.

She whispered and caressed him at the same time. without making it difficult to explain
herself. Embarrassed. he slowly woke up from her passionate body. such
unlike Juna's rather passive body.

There is a theory that we discard socio-psychological conventions then from the point of view of physiology a teenager and a woman about forty are the best sexual partners. This theory was
proven more than once this night in this apartment.

It seems. that the passion of the mistress knew no bounds. Wook had
the ability to recover quickly is an important advantage of the young man.
He fell asleep just before dawn, half completely devastated.

From that day on, the holiday began to be repeated every night. Tireless in the morning
May the hostess went to work as if nothing had happened, lack of sleep
It didn't reflect on her at all. Wook woke up for lunch, ate breakfast and
sat down to study Master Wu's games.

Wook studied selflessly, without giving himself breaks. The only one
her request was to prepare dinner for them. until she returns. But
Then other lessons awaited him. I learned a lot of new things from the hostess.
She became his second teacher after Nek.

TEACHER CHENG

Wook woke up on a Sunday at two in the afternoon and first thing lit a cigarette. Six days had passed since the beginning of his new life.

Three days ago, school started, but Wook hadn't been there once. Not because he didn't want to wake up early, but mainly because Mr. Kwon could be waiting for him at the gates, and Wook avoided a possible encounter with his father.

Also, going to school in uniform after another night spent in such a disgraceful activity...

Nevertheless, Wook had to go to school. If he was planning to finish it, of course. Unexcused absences would only worsen the situation. Wook wasn't overly concerned about his diploma; he regretted the three years spent in school. He could have dropped out a long time ago, but being expelled a month before graduation would be foolish. He needed to pull himself together and finish what he started. The first kyu doesn't accept defeat, passively folding hands, even if the situation isn't in his favor.

Mr. Cheng's house was easy to find. Before making the call, Wook hesitated for a moment. Taking urgent measures to address the emerging problems, Wook was counting on this meeting.

The teacher was at home. Despite being taken by surprise, he nonetheless invited his student into the house.

"Hello, Wook! What brings you? Come in."

His wife came out of the kitchen and also greeted the guest.

"Sorry for the mess in the house - our kids are still small, and I can't keep up."

"Don't worry, please. I didn't notice anything."

"Why don't you offer us some tea or something else? And make sure the kids don't come in," he said, addressing his wife. Cheng was preparing for a serious conversation with Wook. He sensed something significant: Wook hadn't been to school for three days, and it wasn't customary to visit a teacher at home without notice.

They sat across from each other. Mrs. Cheng brought tea and snacks into the room and left. For a while, both remained silent. No one wanted to make the first move. Soon, it dawned on Wook that he should start.

"Sir, I've come to ask you for a favor."

His opponent maintained silence, waiting for the continuation.

"I would like to practice Go until I finish school. I'm here to ask for your permission, sir."

"And does your father know about this?"

Of course.

Then it's simple. Let your father come to the school and sign the necessary papers.

Okay... um, but that's impossible because he's... on a mission.

Cheng lit a cigarette and spoke slowly.

You'd better tell the truth, Wook. You ran away from home, didn't you?
The old member of the "Northwest Youth" retained the sharpness of his senses. Wook now felt like an arrested communist spy being interrogated. He had no choice but to speak the truth.

Wook started by telling why and how he ran away from the house, then described the details of his current life. However, he couldn't summon the courage to talk about his relationship with the landlady. He concealed nothing else, including the match with the troublemakers in the Seoul club.

Wook finished his story, and Cheng didn't utter a word. The teacher smoked, silently looking at him. Wook also wanted to smoke but hesitated; his throat felt dry.

Cheng finally broke the silence.

You're not planning to go back to school at all?

I don't want to run into my father.

This means you can't take responsibility for your actions and proves that you are guilty!

Not quite, if you don't mind. Korean traditions don't allow me to resist my father's will to bring me home, no matter how right I am. Faced with him, I would have to obey his orders. There are no other options. I want to avoid such a situation.

In other words, you can't take responsibility for your actions?

Yes, sir.

Are you sure?

Since I've chosen independence, I can stand my ground. Then, under certain circumstances, I must become a professional and prove that I didn't need to go to university.

Wook was surprised at himself, confidently speaking about such unattainable things. But this meeting, his last and only chance, added courage. Cheng fell silent again. After a while, he startled Wook with a question.

How close are you to that girl I met you with that day? Anyway, it seems that's not the point. I'm sure the most you had between you was holding hands. Usually, I can determine that by looking at faces.

Wook considered recalling Ina in this situation unnecessary. Cheng continued,

In my youth, I considered trust the most important thing. And I've decided to trust you. I'll take care of your absence. You'll finish school without attending. There are only thirty days left, so it's not difficult to arrange.
But you must promise me something in return, man to man. Promise that you won't come to me until you become a professional. You have to do this to learn to take responsibility for your actions. If you don't become a pro, at least your diploma will be lost, for me at least. I don't want to be an accomplice who destroyed your future by helping you drop out of university.

I won't accept you if it means something to you until you become either a professional or a university graduate. I don't care how long it takes: thirty, fifty, a hundred years... But don't come back until you've done one of the two. Do you promise?

I'm glad you're considering it. It means you're taking all circumstances into account. You'll answer in a few days.
— There's no need for that, sir. I promise to become either a professional or a university graduate! And one more thing. I'll remember your help for the rest of my life, even if we never meet again.

Cheng saw off Wook. He was still standing in the doorway when Wook disappeared from sight. Cheng liked Wook, the anomaly of School K. In ten years of working at the school, he had not encountered anyone like Wook.

Clever, unlike the others — Cheng thought. He wanted Wook to become the husband of his 13-year-old daughter and hoped that the woman who cared for Wook now sincerely and fully supported him. The teacher felt uneasy, throwing Wook into the uncertainty of the real world. He would do it, despite everything! The teacher believed in his best student.

PART TWO...
BEFORE BLOCKING, PLAY WITHIN

The proverb says, "Before blocking, play within." Quite often, it is necessary to play into the opponent's territory to create a weakness for subsequent exploitation. The first of the three moves suggested by the spirits of Jowa in the "Game Coughing Blood" was precisely such an inside move - oke.

In the end, Wook became a graduate of School K. Naturally, he did not participate in the "last bell" ceremony. Mr. Kwon personally came to collect his certificate after graduation. Despite all of Mr. Kwon's efforts, Wook did not encounter his father. And, in the end, the father stopped trying to find his son.

Life in sin with the mistress ended in less than a month
syats. Mysterious and arousing interest at first. she didn't bring it
worthwhile satisfaction. As the relationship continued,
the woman tried to control him more and more. Wook started
understand that it is impossible to completely satisfy this woman. She
I wanted to be more than just a mistress. but n older sister and mother. And
mentor in all his affairs.

One fine day, Wook simply disappeared from the apartment while she was at work. The landlady missed Wook terribly, but finding him was impossible. Both she and Mr. Kwon had to stop their futile searches, but both continued to believe that one day he would return.

Wook rented a room in the N. area, not far from where Nok lived. His room was furnished almost as poorly as Nok's old room. His belongings consisted of some clothes, a Go set, and a few books. He even had to buy a blanket and a mat; he couldn't afford a bed, so he slept on the floor.

He couldn't cook either as he didn't have a pot. Lunch had to be improvised wherever possible, which was inconvenient and expensive, but there was no other choice. For the first time in his life, Wook understood why one could die of hunger when there was no money. After paying the rent for the first month, he had only 12 banknotes left.

He switched from "Spipaua" cigarettes to "Zap". Instant noodles for 20 won replaced the 50-won Chinese noodles.

One day, unexpected images of his mother's hot pot and the landlady's pork cutlets appeared before him. To try them, he had to either declare unconditional surrender to his father or yield to the landlady, agreeing to wear the funny pants and red shirt she bought. Shaking his head, he opened the door to the cafe where they served quick-cook noodles.

A week had passed since Wook gained independence. Tired of the monotony, he decided to visit the US club. And there he ran into Iku!

"Iku! Long time no see!"

"Hey, Wook! Is it really you? How you've changed! Probably graduated from school, all grown up now! And here I am, hanging out, hoping to meet you! Dong, the spoiled kid, doesn't even respond to my calls. It's not as bad as he thinks to be an overgrown student. You know how impossible he can be sometimes. Let's go have a drink; we have to celebrate the reunion!"

The friends went to the nearest snack bar. Iku was completely different – he looked like a confident, grown-up man. This meeting felt like a happy dream that suddenly became reality. Wook was no longer alone in this world; now he had Iku with him! He wanted to shout for joy, and Iku felt the same. He smiled broadly, telling Wook about life in Dongdaemun.

"You and Dong must have been disappointed that I didn't let you know when I left. I'm really sorry if it upset you. But when I left, I didn't intend to stay there. I just wanted to see the city, but when I realized how much money you could earn there – really a lot – I decided to stay immediately."

Iku pulled out an American cigarette and handed it to Wook.

"Guess how I started making a ton of bucks, Wook. Tell me. Very interesting!"

"It was a business with American soldiers. These Yankees are so dumb."

"What business?"

"I organized poker games for them. Think you can't make much on that? Not at all! You know how much I usually earned in one night? On average, two hundred dollars. Two hundred dollars is sixty thousand won! I set a fee: during the game, 1% of the bet with each increase. Sounds trivial? It's not at all. Do you know how many times they raised the bet in just one night? An astronomical number!"

The maximum a poker player could get is a hundred dollars. And that means the guys worked hard to pay me, haha. These Yankees are so foolish that they didn't understand such an obvious fact. Although, understandably, some of them didn't even finish elementary school. The winner usually feels great, thanks me for organizing the evening, for clean ashtrays and coffee. He says, "Mr. Choi, top-notch!" But everyone takes turns being winners, and after a while, I became the "top-notch" for everyone. So whenever any of my regular clients met me on the street, they always asked to arrange a poker night. I didn't need to advertise my business, haha. Couldn't they get a room themselves? They would have saved money.

"It's not that simple; they can't get a room themselves. Army rules prohibit poker for money on military grounds. There, by the way, are plenty of people ready to fleece them. I was the only one with a conscience. Some charged a hundred dollars just for the room, and that's nothing. There were those who colluded with corrupt cops and organized armed raids on rooms that they had just rented. They confiscated the money and immediately divided it among themselves on the table. So I had to hire big guys for security. Gradually, among the Yankees, the opinion spread that my place was the safest. Moreover, I never let the losers leave upset—I invited a girl for each one. The tactic worked, and they thought of me almost like God. All of them, meeting me, would say, 'Mr. Choi, top-notch!'"

"So you made a fortune."

"Alas, no. Out of two hundred dollars, thirty went to the guards, twenty for room rent, and five for each girl, on top of what the Yankees themselves paid the girls to ensure good service. So the net profit was a hundred dollars."

"But even that's a lot of money!"

"Yes, but keeping it turned out to be not easy. The city is tempting; I spent most of it on drinks and girls, almost nothing was left. But I don't regret anything; I had a grand time."

"Then why did you leave if it was so good there? Could have stayed for at least a couple more years..."

"You can't imagine what life was like there... All the rejects of the world gathered there. There's not a single soul you can trust. It's not a place where you can stay for long... I got involved in an unpleasant story there... I had to leave, or rather, run away from there."

Iku didn't want to talk about it and quickly changed the subject.

— Are you still dating that girl, the volleyball player from School 57?

— You mean Inae? Yes, from time to time. Although I haven't seen her
for about a month. And how about you? Still seeing Won?

— You still remember her name?! What a memory! The last time I saw
her was before leaving for Dongducheon. Although I'm planning to meet
her again. Heard she plays volleyball for a bank.

— She had a brother, a troublemaker, right?

— No, that was a little lie! Girls sometimes lie without reason. She was
from the C district and lived alone at the time. By the way, did you settle
your relationship?

— No... And you?

— Casanova! Did it on the third date. Before doing anything else, you
have to lay her down. All those arrogant chicks, too proud and difficult to
deal with, turn into lambs when you lay them. And you, first-year, don't you
know this basic rule? There's a saying in Baduk about this!

A mediocre player, Iku hinted at the principle of "Play inside before out-
side." But it seems he was right. The saying, it seems, also applied to
girls. Wook thought about Inae. Soon, Inae's innocent face was replaced by
the faces of Juna and the landlady. A sense of guilt overwhelmed Wook, and
he pushed away those thoughts. No, Inae is not like them.

— Hey! Don't be so serious! Let's go somewhere else, get something
better to drink. I have enough money to get you drunk.

They went to another bar, quiet but not too expensive. Wook persuaded
his persistent friend to come here instead of going to a "real bar."

After Iku's story about his adventures, it was Wook's turn. He told his
story as a fugitive. True, he didn't have the courage to tell everything
about his relationship with the landlady, and he lied that he left her be-
cause he didn't want to burden her anymore.

— You're really in a tough spot, Wook. Take this.

Iku took a stack of five-hundred bills from his inner pocket and handed
them to Wook. Ten thousand won. Wook started to refuse.

Iku, please! I shared my story not to evoke sympathy.
— Shut up and take the money! I usually don't just give it to anyone.
But it's you, Wook. Wouldn't you do the same in my place? Otherwise, I
don't want to see you anymore!

Wook took the money reluctantly but with great gratitude. He was deeply
touched: Iku was a true friend.

— Hey, Wook. All you have to do now is become a pro. They say you can make a living by playing if you're a pro. And until then, I'll support you, don't worry.

— I can't be under your wing forever. Actually, I was planning to look for a job...

— I don't think so, sir. The only place that will take you is a company job as a gofer. But, considering your physique, I doubt you can be a laborer. Okay, if you want to earn on your own, I suggest baduk.

— Baduk? I've never tried.

— Everything is done for the first time. You can learn. If you're interested, I can find you opponents. I did it a couple of times for Dong when we needed cash. I may only be a 10th kyu, but I'm the best baduk manager!

Wook decided to take the advice. It seemed like the only way to salvation.

Starting the next day, Wook began playing baduk with opponents carefully selected by Iku, who negotiated the terms with them. The stakes weren't as high as with Nek, around "50 won, 30 won," but it was enough to quit "bap" and instant noodles.

Opponents were usually weaker, third-fourth kyu. They were given a handicap of lv - four stones higher than usual to lure weaker players into playing for money. And soon, Wook honed his skill in playing with a handicap against weaker opponents.

Following his manager's advice, Wook allowed the opponent to win a game to make them a regular client. People with inflated egos and self-confidence about their strength were plentiful, making the new business thrive.

The player and his manager traveled all over the city, meeting generous opponents. According to Iku, he was sly and only found easy opponents for Wook. Players of uncertain strength were either rejected immediately or played trial matches before playing for money. Wook found that he became tougher and more ruthless. A whole new world opened up for him, where survival was possible only by being cold-blooded and tough! Luxuries like warmth and care were unacceptable if you wanted to win. In this world, only winners survive.

The "Lake" tea house near the US Club was chosen as the place where business plans were drawn up and calculations were made. Here, Wook and Iku discussed strategies, stakes for future matches, and the distribution of earnings.

As usual, Wook had to give in; Iku explained that, in reality, the player earns the money and deserves 70% accordingly. Wook appreciated Iku's generous terms for their partnership. However, he still considered 30% for his manager unfair, as without Iku's expertise, Wook wouldn't have earned a penny. Iku was more than just a friend to Wook; he became almost like an older brother.

The owner of "The Lake," Mrs. Keng, was a widow in her early thirties. She had her eye on Wook and took certain steps. Wook, who had never taken any action in this regard, wasn't very involved. Naturally, Iku, his manager, had to intervene. He arranged a romantic dinner for the future lovers. Mrs. Keng was so approachable that even for Wook, it was no trouble becoming her lover. They started dating once a week, Wednesday nights, before her weekend shift, at the "Longevity" motel...

For Mrs. Keng, Wook was a messenger from heaven: a twenty-year-old young man with exceptional skills in bed. After a month of rigorous sessions with the landlady, Wook acquired a new positive quality.

The rendezvous with Mrs. Keng once a week was perfect for Wook: these relationships didn't disrupt his unpredictable schedule, and baduk sessions often continued all night.

Thus, Wook's independent life was developing quite successfully. There was money for expenses and an attractive partner. The only thing left was to study baduk games to become a pro. Wook was going through a book on the third circle.

Now, Wook highly valued the truth of the proverb: "Play inside before playing outside." His departure from the pawnshop was the first move inside. Mrs. Keng also became attached to him after that internal move. Thoughts of Inae flashed through his mind. Could this proverb also apply to her? With a bitter smirk, Wook shook his head and opened "Master Wook's Games."

GREED FOR VICTORY WILL DRIVE AWAY VICTORY

One of the commandments of Go states: "Greed for victory will scare victory away."

Its meaning is clear: if the desire for victory is too great, the precise plan and strategy drown in emotions, and the desired victory cannot be achieved. Calmness is particularly necessary in winning positions.

The player's main goal is to win, but the desire for victory must be controlled and balanced with a calm strategy and thoughtful decisions. As soon as greed for victory prevails, defeat is guaranteed. Many players ignore this fundamental principle, and those who violate the rule rarely manage to understand the reason for their defeat.

In two weeks, the spring qualifying tournament is scheduled. Of course, Wook applied for participation. He missed the previous autumn tournament, as the dates coincided with the final exams at school. He hoped that Dong would also participate in the tournament. In the previous tournament, Dong, who played directly in the final, performed poorly, losing more than half of the games, and now he had to start from the qualifying round again. This is all Wook could find out about Dong since their last meeting about a year ago. Wook went against his wishes, trying to find a friend. Dong, in turn, did nothing to meet with Wook. Even Iku agreed not to search for Dong for now.

Although Wook could no longer smoke "Zlual," and "Spipada" was something he could not afford, it seemed that Iku was also not satisfied with his financial situation. Small stakes in bannegi could not support both Wook and Iku. Nevertheless, Wook was grateful that he was no longer dependent on "Zlual" cigarettes and instant noodles. Iku's nature was such that he never complained about anything.

One day, Iku appeared at "Ozero," radiant and excited. The joy on his face indicated that he had found a "big fish" – an opponent who wants to play for high stakes.

"Wook, Mr. Stupido is finally hooked! Do you know who he is? A big fish, a very big one, we've never had anything like this!"

"And who is he?"

"Hello, my future sister-in-law! You look more beautiful every day, which means you'll soon have a handsome prince, unlike my brother, haha."

"Keep your silly jokes to yourself! Watch your mouth when talking to your elders!"

After Iku chased away Madame Keng with his usual jokes, he became serious again and lit a cigarette.

"Do you know the breakfast area near the Independence Gate, a few blocks from here? He has a chain of bars there. He's old, around sixty. His business includes alcohol, food, and girls. They say he has excelled in this business, a well-known scoundrel. He loves bannegi, although he always looks for weak players to make easy money. Being a real miser, he always asks for too much handicap. So, he rarely plays – not everyone accepts those conditions."

"What's his rank?"

"Fifth kyu. But he's very experienced in bannegi and strong in tsumego. They say he can play at the third or second kyu level. For matches with first kyu players, he has a rule – no less than nine handicap stones! Nine stones! Who will give a fifth kyu player nine stones? Yesterday, I met him, and he agreed to a bet of 500, 200 if the handicap is nine stones. A huge opportunity, but I'm not sure if we can handle him with nine stones. What do you think, Wook?"

Iku didn't want to miss the chance, but he couldn't force Wook into the competition against his will. 500, 200 is indeed a significant bet. Wook understood that playing against a fifth kyu with a nine-stone handicap is a huge risk. However, there is still a chance! Besides, Iku was in a difficult financial situation and now looked at Wook with a plea, as if he possessed a miraculous ability to defeat this wealthy miser.

"Let's give it a try, Iku. I think we'll need at least fifteen thousand for the match. I only have five; do you have five thousand?"

Of course! Five thousand it is. In the worst case, we'll lose twenty thousand, but we'll survive.
Iku expressed complete agreement with Wook's decision.
"We need to meet this guy, Iku, discuss the venue and other details. I want to see him before the match."

The prospect of the biggest bannegi of his life thrilled and excited Wook.

In the evening at the bar, there were very few people. Wook was given a cup of tea while Iku and the old man, whom he called Mr. Stupido, worked out the details. So, the time and place for the meeting were set for Thursday at 9 pm at the "Longevity" motel. This amused Wook; in the same motel, the night before the match, he meets with Madame Keng. It might even be for the better, Wook thought; he could stay there until Thursday and relax. Wook agreed to the time and place.

"I'll be playing with you? Very nice. So young and already first kyu. That's impressive. Have you ever participated in qualification tournaments? No? But still, you must be a good player. Me? I'm very, very bad at the game, just playing for fun. I should probably throw away a lot of money, haha."

Mr. Stupido was a spirited and cunning old man. He tried to find out Wook's true strength, slyly mentioning that he was a bad player. Wook, lying, claimed not to have participated in qualification tournaments to avoid giving him an advantage. But the anxiety about the upcoming match still haunted Wook. Perhaps it would have been better to tell the truth about his participation in the qualification tournament: three losses in the first round. Knowing the truth, the old man wouldn't have been so vigilant. Wook regretted not saying it.

After Iku left for his business, Wook returned to "Ozero." Sitting at the table and sipping coffee brought by Madame Keng, Wook immersed himself in thoughts. He tried to devise a strategy for the upcoming match, but he didn't even know the true strength of his opponent. Nek, who had been preparing for one match for five months, would scoff at Wook's foolishness. Suddenly, a smile lit up Wook's face. He could use Nek's strategy – allowing the opponent to win a couple of times to inflate their ego and false belief in their abilities and then, playing on their emotions, crush them. This could work against Mr. Stupido. Wook recalled Nek's words to enhance the effectiveness of this strategy. It could become a powerful weapon in the match. Wook felt better already.

"What are you thinking about, my dear?" Madame Keng asked, sitting beside him and teasing his thigh under the table. "Let's go to Pine Island tomorrow. It's only an hour's taxi ride. We can return on Thursday," she whispered in his ear.

"Sorry, I can't tomorrow. I have business on Thursday evening."

The offer was tempting, but Wook wouldn't jeopardize the fate of an important match for a woman. Daytime on Thursday was also part of the match – he needed to rest before the night game.

"I understand. Maybe next Wednesday? Anyway, tomorrow's escapade is not canceled!" Wook nodded with a smile. He liked how Madame Keng took his refusal to the trip. She never bothered him with detailed inquiries. Wook even felt a bit guilty and thought that if the upcoming match went well, he could take her to a better place next Wednesday.

Wook faced two consecutive night battles. The first battle was romantic, but it was still a kind of struggle. Wook had the duties of an executioner, and Madame Keng was the prisoner he had to execute. She revived after each execution to demand the next one. Both fulfilled their duties all night, and the battle ended peacefully at dawn. There were no winners or losers; the result in this battle wasn't as important as the process.

On Thursday afternoon, Wook slept to be ready for the next battle where the final result would determine everything. Waking up at 4 pm, he began to prepare – took a bath, went to the hairdresser, and on the way back bought cigarettes. It was already 6:30 pm.

Wook called the boy from the staff and chose another room. At Wook's request, the boy brought a board and stones. Then Wook gave the boy 500 won in tips with a request to avoid accommodating anyone in the adjacent rooms if possible – it would be undesirable to hear frenzied exclamations during the heat of the game. The boy left, thanking the generous guest with a deep bow.

Iku appeared at the beginning of eight.

"How are you feeling? Don't worry if you lose. I don't care much about it. Some damn ten thousand... Did you meet her yesterday as usual? What the hell did you do to her that she seems completely mad? Do you have some secret way of dealing with women?!" Iku was trying to distract him, and Wook understood that. He just smiled, looking at his nervous friend. Wook didn't need Iku's help right now; he was already calm. He felt the warrior spirit rising within him. Obviously, Wook was a warrior by nature. Mr. Stupido arrived at ten minutes to nine.

— Have you been waiting long? Let's begin. It's not necessary to start precisely at nine. So, the stakes are 500 to 200. Twenty-five thousand each, right?

Wook followed him and placed the money under the board. Wook felt that his opponent was in a hurry. It seemed he was overly confident and not holding a high opinion of Wook. It was a good sign: in crucial matches, underestimating the opponent should be avoided.

Nevertheless, Mr. Stupido's playing style was solid, indicating experience playing with stronger opponents. Right from the start, he went for a solid defense. It's very challenging to win with a nine-stone handicap if the black intentionally plays defensively. Beating an opponent with such a style is difficult, but losing is very easy. Wook followed his losing strategy with some resilience. The first game ended with a victory for black with a slight lead - eight points, one ban.

"Yes... Nine stones are too many. Five or six would be more appropriate."

Wook tried to replicate Nek's actions when giving away the lost money - 700 won.

"An agreement costs more than money!" Mr. Stupido hastily placed nine stones on the board, as if afraid that he would be asked to change the handicap size.

In the second game, Mr. Stupido continued his defensive tactics. However, unlike the first game, he cautiously attempted to play more offensively – a sure sign that he felt more confident. Wook allowed some of his stones to be surrounded, gaining strong influence in the center in return. His opponent, not strong enough to accurately assess the consequences of such an exchange, felt confident in his attacking abilities.

The second game ended with a victory for black by five points, again one ban. The old man looked puzzled: his advantage in the game had not changed even after a successful local fight.

"Only one ban? Strange..."

"Yes, I was afraid the loss would be at least three bans..."

Wook helped the opponent feel even more confused. The effect was wonderful: Mr. Stupido had never encountered a first kyu who made such mistakes in the result. He began to doubt that he was facing a first kyu and felt that he was only wasting time playing defensively.

He suddenly became aggressive, fighting for his life and victory with a significant advantage, maybe even for the best possible result.

Wook thanked God that his patience in the previous games was rewarded and began to retaliate. He ignored the attack against his group and played in another area. Wook saw that his group couldn't be killed; there was a move ensuring its life under any circumstances. The move was complicated enough that a player of his opponent's level would notice it, and Wook was sure of that.

The old man's eyes sparkled like those of a predator tracking its prey. He began a large-scale offensive, driving the white stones into his own territory. He was confident in capturing a large group. The sounds of his stones hitting the board became louder and louder. His heart pounded in anticipation of the manban – 25 hundred at once! Wook maneuvered his group around the opponent's territory, reducing it to ten points, and made a long-prepared move, surviving. The opponent was stunned and remained inactive for a long five minutes. The game soon ended. Wook won by 62 points, seven bans. Mr. Stupido had to pay nineteen hundred won, five hundred more than the sum of his two wins with one ban each. Knowing how bannegi worked, he was furious that after two victories, he couldn't just win the manban against this fake first kyu. He firmly believed it was solely his mistake, not Wook's brilliant move. Such anger and frustration are common reactions from a weak player.

"What a foolish mistake I made, allowing this group to survive. It had no way to escape!"

"You're right, sir. But I have to exploit any mistake with such an unwarranted handicap. Otherwise, I would lose the manban every time."

Wook reinforced his opponent's false belief, emphasizing the word "manban" to make it stick in his subconscious. The fact that the group of white stones was alive before the attack began remained a secret that the old man would never learn. Finally, the desire to take the manban completely possessed Mr. Stupido. He forgot that his opponent was a first kyu and wanted to regain the manban he almost got in the previous game.

Mr. Stupido's groups behaved similarly to Madam Kang the previous night. Wook became the executioner, repeating his executions regularly, just like the previous night. Although, of course, there was a difference: there was no truce, and there was no romantic revival. Here, there were winners and losers; after each "execution," Wook's pocket swelled with new bills.

The manban, which the old man passionately desired, happened repeatedly, but each time not in his favor.

In the history of bannegi, there has never been a case where the loser, upset and angered by their own foolishness, could calmly continue playing. This match was no exception. Around 8 a.m., Mr. Stupido ran out of money – for his last defeat, he had to pay from the bank under the board. The first two games were all he managed to win.

Embarrassed and angry, Mr. Stupido demanded a rematch that same evening. Reluctantly, Wook pondered this proposal and replied with something vaguely resembling a "sure." The defeated man stormed out of the room and disappeared. For the first time that night, Wook smiled at Iku, who burst into laughter.

"Wow, hahaha! The old man brought in a lot of money. Towards dawn, I started to worry about our leaking cash. He just kept losing more and more! Are we really lucky, or what's going on here? I'm impressed with you, Wook! How did you do it with such a thirteen-stone handicap thirteen times in a row, with four manbans? Even Dong never agreed to play with a nine-stone handicap!"

"Oh, come on. Luck just smiled at us. At the right moment, the man lost his self-control. Believe me, it wasn't easy."

Wook took out a wad of money from his pocket and handed it to his friend without counting. Wook wanted to give as much as possible. Until this moment, only he himself had been the object of Iku's generosity.

"So much, Wook? Thank you! I really need it today. This is great!"

"Iku, you need more. Take it."

Iku hesitated, then left Wook.

"I have more than enough now. Buy something for your chick. I need to go. I'll call you in the evening at 'The Lake.' If I don't show up or call, call April in the 'Blue Stone'; I'll let her know where I am. See you. Thank you!" Iku hurriedly left the room.

Wook remained alone in the room. Two overflowing ashtrays next to the battlefield indicated how intense the struggle had been. Mr. Stupido lost so much only because he wanted to win too badly. If he had stuck to his style, not succumbing to greed and winning little by little, the tragedy of this night would never have happened to him. Clearly, he had never heard of the first commandment: "Greed for victory will not lead to victory." Wealthy weak players who did not adhere to this commandment were generous sponsors of nervous first kyus like Wook. One of the privileges of the first kyus is to receive such support by learning the commandments and diligently practicing the game.

KO FIGHT

The shape of stones in which black and white can endlessly capture each other one stone at a time is called "ko." Game rules prohibit the repetition of positions; a player must make a move elsewhere before capturing the opponent's stone in a ko situation. The opponent faces a dilemma: to win the ko battle or respond to the ko threat.

This very ko shape provides astronomical possibilities to change the game's pattern. This is one of the reasons why computer programs have struggled only at the beginner level. Ko creates side effects not only in a local situation but also across the entire board.

Ko-fighting has become the main puzzle over thousands of years of the game's history. The best Japanese player of the XX century said before his death, "If there was a possibility of ko, I could prolong my life."

It was around half-past two when Wook left the bapi and returned to "The Lake." There were no messages from Iku, so Wook decided to wait a bit. Mrs. Ken brought coffee.

"Fresh out of the bath? How was the game? Did you play all night?"

"Yes, until eight in the morning. Everything went as planned. How about a trip to Pine Island next Wednesday? Haven't changed your mind?"

She put her hand gently on his thigh, squeezed it tightly, and whispered, "Of course, my dear!"

"Then I'll be here around nine."

"But, Wook... Is everything really okay? The tournament is in ten days. I don't want to disrupt your schedule."

"Don't worry about it. The upcoming tournament is like a warm-up for me. There wouldn't be any problems. I wouldn't have asked you to go if there were."

Wook was grateful that she considered his interests more than her own. A customer was waiting at the counter, and Mrs. Keng hurried to attend to him.

By five o'clock, Iku still hadn't shown up. Wook called April at "Blue Stone." She wasn't very friendly and kept repeating, "Come as soon as possible." Something must have happened to Iku. Worried, Wook rushed out of the cafe and hailed a taxi.

April, who had recently become Iku's new girlfriend, quickly told Wook everything.

"Iku was arrested for a fight. In Dongdaemun, he tried to defend a girl from an assailant. One day, the guy attacked Iku, and Iku fought back a couple of times in self-defense. After that, Iku returned to Seoul. Now this assailant is pursuing legal action, and the police took Iku in handcuffs. What should I do now? Please get him out of there! Please!"

Wook was shocked. April was clearly exaggerating his capabilities—how could he free his friend? All he could do was visit Iku.

At the police station, Wook's request for a meeting was denied. The investigator Wook managed to talk to after a two-hour wait was unfriendly.

"No visitors other than close relatives. A friend? Not a family member. The possibility of release? Are you kidding? No chance! He needs a good lesson!"

Helpless, Wook had no choice but to leave. His best friend was in jail, and he couldn't do anything. According to April, the fight wasn't serious. Wook was sure that if someone influential stood up for Iku, he would be released immediately. But neither Iku nor Wook had such connections. Perhaps Mr. Kwon could help, and Wook was even ready to return with a plea just to help Iku. Then Wook thought of Mr. Park. Yes, Mr. Park, Inae's father, could definitely help.

Certainly, he was a much more suitable option than Inae's father. But Wook still hesitated. He hadn't seen Inae for three months, and besides, he had committed acts that Inae would never forgive him for. Junu could be forgiven, but not his relationships with Mrs. Hostess and Mrs. Keng. It would be unfair to meet Inae and hide his adventures from her.

An hour later, Inae came to meet him at "Blue Stone." Honestly or not, he had to help his friend! After all, he had abandoned his principles. He stood up and called Inae. Before dialing the number, he had to explain to himself several times that it was better to be dishonest than to surrender to his father or leave Iku in jail.

She had changed a lot: her hair had grown to shoulder length, and on her chest, the badge of "Women's University $" was shining.

"Wook! Why didn't you call me all this time? Do you have someone else? No? Then why? You look great with this haircut. I like it."

It was the old Inae again—friendly and bold.

"I'm sorry... There were reasons... So much has happened since our last meeting... Let's have lunch; I have a lot to tell you."

They went to a small restaurant next to the teahouse. Over the meal, Wook shared his story with her. He detailed how he left the dorm and dropped out of university, briefly touching on his current lifestyle and bannegi to survive, carefully avoiding details related to Mrs. Keng.

"I think it's cowardly to run away from home like that... But I respect your decision. You've always turned out to be right. By the way, where are you living now? Cooking for yourself? I understand. But how can you always eat wherever you can?! What about laundry?"

Inae genuinely worried and was interested in him. She bombarded him with endless questions. Wook began to worry, trying to insert the story of Iku's problems at the right moment. Inae expressed a desire to visit him.

"Show me what it looks like. I want to see what it's like. Please!"

"There's nothing to see, Inae."

"Anyway. Please. Take me there."

Wook had to give in. He remembered her house with a huge garden, a living room with a tiger skin, and bitterly smiled at himself.

In Wook's dwelling, Inae fell silent; she was clearly shocked. She couldn't imagine this—tiny and poor room without furniture, neither a bed nor a table.

She dipped her fingers into the bowl of Go stones without saying a word, then
pulled Wook to her. She hugged him tightly. all trembling. Wook answered her,
they kissed. To his amazement, Wook felt seventeen

So ended this day. Wook took her home by bus. The whole way, they remained silent, absorbed in new experiences and the new depth of their relationship.

At her doorstep, Wook realized that Aunt Aku's condition remained unchanged. After what had happened, Wook would never allow himself to talk to her about it. Instead, a new problem emerged.

Wook thought of his relationship with Inae as a ko-fight. Mrs. Hyeja and Mrs. Keng were just ko-threats. Dealing with them, he failed to notice the real ko-fight—Inae. After today's events, Wook had no choice but to face it, to respond to Inae's ko-threat and win the ko. The 1-kyu had made up his mind.

HURRY UP SLOWLY

"Haste makes waste." The next of the ten commandments of Go warns: "Hurry up slowly."

Iku sat and smoked in "Lake" with the look of a triumphant. Wook, who couldn't sleep all night worrying about Iku, couldn't believe his eyes.

Hey! What happened? Were you released?
Of course. I was already worried, thinking you might have caught a cold. Look at yourself - you look terrible. Investigator Lee told me that you were at the police station.

— Yes! But the investigator told me that there is no way to release you. How did you manage to get out?

— The guy stopped being stubborn, agreeing to solve the problem differently. Hello, future sister-in-law, how are you? I am not doing well at all — I won't be able to tease my older sister anymore!

What do you mean, Iku? - asked Mrs. Keng in amazement.

I need to go to Dongdochun for some business. Take good care of Wook, okay?

— These are unexpected things.

She hurried to the counter, despite the strong desire to continue the conversation – a customer loudly complained about the quality of the coffee.

Back to the American base again? The second surprise of the morning. Wook insisted on details.

— In exchange for him withdrawing the statement from the police, this guy wants me to work for free in his laundry for a year. He calculated that he would get much more this way. Using me as a servant, he will get all kinds of pleasures. Well, I don't have much choice. At least it's better than being in jail...

Iku was sad. Wook was upset that he would lose him again soon. He took out all the money he had in his pocket.

— Take it, Iku. This is all I have. Here's fifteen thousand. If you don't take it, you're not my friend!

Wook shoved the money into his pocket. Iku's eyes filled with tears. It was the first time Wook saw Iku cry. Wook himself was barely holding back tears. Suddenly, Iku stood up, quickly shook Wook's hand, and ran out of the teahouse without saying anything to Mrs. Keng.

— How long will Iku be gone? I saw him just run out.

— Yes... for a while. He'll be back in a year, I'm sure... We'll have to cancel the trip to Pine Island... I'm very sorry.

Why? Are you in trouble?
— No.

Wook couldn't tell her that he had no money left for the trip.

— I know. It's because of money, isn't it? I saw it. You're a very good person with a warm heart. But men are sometimes like children! Giving away ALL your money without thinking... I bet you don't even have money left for lunch.

She handed him a piece of paper – a check for 20 thousand.

— This is a loan. Promise to pay it back. - She rushed off to work.

Wook sat stunned for a while. It was an action. He had already decided to part ways with her soon, but now carrying out that decision became difficult. She still remained a part of Wook. He bit his lip hard. This ko-threat was too significant to ignore.

On Wednesday night in the Pine Isles, Mrs. Keng wanted him endlessly. She must have felt his decision and didn't let go of him all night. Wook, as if in denial, returned her passion with fierce love.

Upon returning from the trip, Wook secluded himself in his room for a week to prepare for the tournament. He called Inae and informed her about the tournament schedule. The Master Wook's games were more than enough for analysis. Wook stayed at home, examining the games with only short breaks for meals.

Finally, the day of the tournament arrived. The second floor of the Korean Go Association was packed. As usual, around three hundred people were vying for the professional title.

Dong was also there. He looked like a high school student, perhaps due to his short haircut. Wook greeted him cheerfully.

"Hey, Dong! What do you think about the tournament? Are you confident that it will go well for you this time?"

"You should know better, Wook. I heard that you've improved a lot. Ikoo told me before he left. Do you know that he returned to Dongdocheon?"

The prolonged hiatus in their relationship could be filled only by sitting somewhere quiet with a few bottles of soju. Wook hoped that day would come.

Wook managed to reach the third round. Master Wook's games significantly advanced his skills. However, he objectively assessed his strength after only one victory in the third round. Ahead of him was a long path of improvement.

Dong, it seemed, had also been practicing a lot. After an outstanding result in the qualifying rounds — nine victories — he made it to the final. But the bar proved too high for Dong. With a result of +6-4, he secured a spot in the next tournament's final.

Leaving the Go Association building, Wook saw Inae waiting for him at the entrance.

"Inae! How did you find this place?"

"I read about the tournament in the newspaper and asked Dad."

"Thanks for coming. Let's go grab lunch."

Wook hurriedly led her away because Dong would show up any minute. Inae might have understood Dong with his short haircut, but he would surely be uncomfortable being seen like that.

In a nearby restaurant, she ordered the signature breaded cutlet, the landlady's specialty. Without feeling guilty, Wook ordered an omelet.

"How did the games go?"

"Two good players became first dan professionals, and the rest remained first kyu..."

— Dad says becoming a professional is harder than passing the bar exams. Is it true?

— Of course, there's no comparison.

— Then it's really tough! Do you think you'll make it?

— I don't know. I'm trying. It's my only goal. You might call me an ordinary guy, but there's something more here. For example, maybe my great-grandfather's influence on me. Want to know about him?

He told her a story he heard from his brother. Inae found it very interesting.

"That's quite a story! I can almost feel your great-grandfather watching over you from heaven and taking care of you. I'll tell Dad about it. Oh, I almost forgot! Dad invited you to our place tonight, if you're not busy."

"Why? To play Go?"

"Not exactly. I hope you won't mind... I told everything about you to Mom and Dad. Nothing?"

"About me running away from home?"

"Yes... and everything else too."

Wook felt uneasy. She could very well have told them about the incident between them a few days ago. Oh, American manners! Wook went to her, feeling like a criminal awaiting judgment.

Mr. Park greeted Wook warmly. He didn't resemble a judge ready to pronounce a death sentence at all.

"How's the tournament? The third round? Great!"

You still have a long way to go, sir. I need to practice more.

When Inae and her mother left the room, leaving them alone, Mr. Park calmly looked at Wook.

"I'm sure you're familiar with the commandment 'hasten slowly.' Now you have two problems in front of you that are suggested to be solved by following this advice.

The first one is Inae. She's still a naive girl, unfamiliar with the real world. But one thing is certain. She loves you very much. I don't adhere to this traditionally Korean view, and I'm not demanding responsibility from you. For me, if love between two people is physically expressed, it's fine. But you must understand that I am her father. As a father, I don't want her to bear the pain of these relationships, which promise to be beautiful. That's why I ask you to slow down and be careful. I know you're too young to get married. I'll be grateful if you approach this with the necessary seriousness.

Wook felt deep respect for Mr. Park. He asked Wook not to treat Inae as just one of his entertainment partners. Wook was almost ready to promise to marry her, but he stopped himself, remembering Mr. Park's warning about the commandment "hasten slowly." Mr. Park continued.

"The second problem is your Go career. You are much stronger than me as a player. But sometimes it's useful to listen to the advice of a weaker player. I respect your decision to sacrifice university for Go, especially because I can imagine, maybe vaguely, how difficult it is to become a pro. Moreover, your decision, undisturbed by old prejudices, deserves respect.

On the other hand, you are again violating this commandment by pursuing your goal. Leaving home without a clear plan on how to be independent is, to put it mildly, a hasty action. And also, starting to prepare for the championship a week before it means that you don't have a clear and unwavering plan.

Mr. Park showed how inconsistent Wook was in his efforts to become a pro. Wook felt ashamed.

"I'm not saying you should go back home. You're an adult now. Your responsibilities as an adult are just as important as your rights. I believe you will be accountable for your actions.

Allow me to make a small suggestion. I know a small Buddhist temple in the mountains, not far from Seoul, a two-hour drive. Will you practice there until the next tournament? They charge for accommodation and meals. It would be preferable for you to handle the bills yourself. If that's impossible, I'm willing to lend you money. What do you think?"

"Give me some time to think, sir. I'll give you an answer tomorrow evening."

"If I overstepped, crossed any boundaries, forgive me, please. I just wanted to help."

"Not at all. I appreciate your involvement."

On the way home, Wook kept thinking about the commandment "hasten slowly." That's exactly what he needed now. He was very grateful to Mr. Park for the timely advice. Wook met his third teacher.

RENOUNCE THE SMALL TO ATTAIN THE GREAT

The next of the ten commandments says: "Give up the small to achieve the great."

One must be willing to sacrifice the small to attain something more significant. This seemingly simple advice is often ignored by those who stubbornly cling to trivialities, losing more important things in the process.

Wook decided to go to the mountains. First, he went to work with his elder brother to see him. It was challenging to persuade Bu to lend him money. For an assistant inspector in a large company, two hundred thousand won was too large a sum. Still, the loyal brother managed to gather the money, muttering, "If Dad finds out, he'll kill me!"

Before leaving, Wook did not forget about those "small things" that he had left behind for something greater. First, he wrote a letter to Mrs. Keng, addressing her by name.

"Yun! I have to leave without saying goodbye. I am very grateful to you for your help during this time; I felt good with you. I will be gone for about six months to focus solely on Go. I hope we will meet again when I return. I will miss you terribly. Wook.

P.S. I left the money with the caretaker at 'The Lake.' Thanks for the loan."

Wook imagined how she would look reading the letter. She would remain calm. Even if he had come to say goodbye, she wouldn't have stopped him. Wook regretted betraying her trust in this way.

Now he had to write to the landlady.

"Dear Mrs. Keng, I am very sorry that I left without saying goodbye. Please forgive my cruelty. I am leaving Seoul for a while to study Go. I will never forget your kindness during a difficult time for me. Thank you and farewell. Wook."

Wook sent the letters by mail and felt relieved.

Inae was also one of the "small things" he left behind temporarily. She didn't need letters. She came to the bus station and brought with her a map to the temple drawn by her father. They sat together in a pastry shop near the station.

"That's how it is. For about six months, it will be challenging for us to meet. I need to focus on my studies, and you need to go to school."

"What's wrong with me visiting you?" Wook anticipated this question and delivered a speech he had carefully prepared for such an occasion.

"I'll be waiting for you, Inae. But it should not be more than once a month. More frequent meetings would undermine the purpose of the mountain trip. But you MUST come at least once a month. Otherwise, I might run down from the mountain to see you."

The prepared speech ended as Inae didn't object too much to this rule.

"Okay, if you think so. I will come once a month. Plus, I will write letters. You don't have to reply—you shouldn't distract yourself from your studies."

"I know you feel it. Please try to understand. Six months will pass somehow."

He tightly squeezed her hand, and she responded in kind. A sudden impulse overwhelmed him to forget everything and stay with her in Seoul. But he remembered the crucial commandment just in time: "Give up the small for the sake of the great."

The temple was easy to find. It was located in the mountains, a thirty-minute walk from the bus stop. Near the temple, Wook spotted a familiar car and was very surprised. Mr. Park was waiting for Wook.

— Don't be surprised. I'm not here to prepare for the tournament. I came to introduce you to the head monk. Even Inae doesn't know I'm here. See that house over there? The head monk lives there with his family. This temple belongs to a denomination that allows marriage. The monk's family members are not vegetarians, so your food won't strictly be vegetarian. You'll be living in that house. Room and meals cost six thousand won per month. I've already paid for the first month as a welcome for your arrival. The head monk is in the ceremony room. Or, talk to him. He already knows who you are. I've done everything, and now I'm leaving. Goodbye!

He turned to the monk and shouted:

— Your Holiness! I'm leaving. Thank you for everything!

After a deep bow to the monk, Mr. Park got into his car and drove away. The head monk escorted Wook to the room, where a package with a letter awaited him.

"Wook, I am grateful that you accepted my offer. I leave you 'Games of Takagawa' in seven volumes. I bought them in Japan. I'm sure you know who Takagawa is. These famous words belong to him: 'The flowing water does not compete for the first place.' This principle teaches not to fight against the natural course of things. The talent for balance of Master Wook plus the resilience of Takagawa will make you a great player, I'm sure. Sangsu Park

P.S. I left ten packs of 'Chunja' to save you a few trips to the store."

Mr. Park was a man to look up to. Perhaps he had meticulously planned Wook's trip down to the details. Maybe it was motivated by something more than just love for his daughter. Mr. Park was a caring man attentive to things and principles he valued.

Wook began unpacking his things: a bit of clothing, two Go sets, a few books. Wook also opened the package and gradually settled into the room. The books were arranged one after another: Takagawa, Wook, and a thin book of poems with a story about Intetsu. Lessons in the mountains began.

Six days passed. The sessions consisted of ongoing battles against boredom, loneliness, impulses to abandon everything, and arguments swirling in his mind about why the mountain sessions should be canceled. In short, it was a battle with himself. Wook wrote in big letters on a sheet, "Overcoming Oneself," and pinned it to the wall. The most significant obstacle in the struggle with oneself was the presence of leisure.

Soon he realized that the sum of two hundred thousand exceeded his needs. He paid the head monk thirty thousand for five months and set aside an additional two thousand just in case. With a few days left, Wook decided to send back the money to Bu the next day. However, he didn't have to descend from the mountain to go to the post office. Inae arrived on the seventh day.

— Hey, didn't we agree to limit visits to once a month?!

Wook was happy to see her, although he grumbled for the sake of form.

— This isn't a violation of the agreement. Yes, once a month. But we didn't count the first meeting as a day. So now I'll come in a month. The roads here are bad, and my father gave me his car, saying it should only be given once a month. He's like you, Wook. Okay, I'll faithfully keep the agreement, so don't look at me, please, so scared. You do like to see me here, don't you! Ah, you're smiling! I missed you so much.

Against the backdrop of the mountains, Inae sparkled with radiant beauty. Her sweet endless chatter didn't bother him at all. The chocolate and cookies she brought showed him how much she missed him. Wook sat next to her, listening, and tightly held her hand. Only the appearance of the driver reminded him that it was time to give the money to Inae and instruct her not to reveal his whereabouts under any circumstances. Bu could be trusted, but he wouldn't be able to refuse his father and keep the secret. If Mr. Kwon came here, it would be the end of everything Wook fought for.

After Inae's departure, a difficult time of returning to work came for Wook. Placing the board in front of him, he opened Master Wook's book. Perseverance had to be shown. The obstacle in the form of money no longer existed. Inae wouldn't be here for a whole month, leaving him only with studies. Wook gritted his teeth and made the first move on the board from the annotated game of Master Wook.

BE VIGILANT AMONG ENEMIES

People often forget themselves when behind enemy lines. This usually ends in tragedy. The commandment says: 'Be extremely attentive when encountering a formidable opponent and be vigilant among enemies.'

On the fifth month of his stay in the mountains, during the study of Master Wu's games on the eighth circle, enlightenment descended upon Wook, akin to Buddha under the tree or Jesus after forty days in the desert. Starting from that day, Master Wu's moves began to make sense. Answers to questions came easily. Wook reached a new level; he understood how clumsy his previous games were. Finally, the game of Go revealed its secrets to him.

A sense of satisfaction overwhelmed him – similar to what Einstein must have felt when he saw particles under the microscope, the existence of which he deduced from calculations. Confucius said: 'Any book reveals its content after you read it a hundred times.' Wook achieved his goal after the eighth time and rightfully considered himself fortunate. For the remaining time, Wook analyzed all the games twice more, paying attention to the analysis of mistakes and inaccuracies. As Nak suggested, Wook reviewed all games ten times, totaling more than three thousand games.

Wook finally descended from the mountains back to the city. First, he went straight to work with his baggage. His brother, Bu, hastily came down to the company's tea room.

Wook! Finally. How's life in the mountains? Tough?
— Can't complain. I chose it myself.

Anyway, it must have been tough for you. How were the lessons? Sometimes I admire the oboe. The mere existence of such a person in our family is amazing. The money I piled up like that, why did I return it?

When you want to concentrate, money blocks the way...

— Blocks the way? Oh, wow! You must have really studied a lot! And that girl who brought the money? Is she your girlfriend? You prepared her well — no matter what I say, she wouldn't reveal where you are! Alright, let's go home, you'll freshen up, eat well, and tell me about life in the mountains.

— Sorry, I can't... Can you lend me some money? I need twelve thousand to rent a room.

Okay, I won't argue. Now I know how stubborn you are. Twenty thousand is not a big deal; wait a minute, I'll bring the money.
Bu went for the money. Wook was grateful to his brother for unconditional help. He regretted a bit that he had to do everything his own way, against his brother's will.

As before, Wook settled in the N area. He rested on the first day, and on the next, early morning, he went to the Association to register for the tournament starting in a week.

Throughout the week, Wook stayed at home, honing what he achieved in the mountains. Only once did he visit Inae's house to inform Mr. Park of his arrival. After lunch, Wook took Inae for a walk, the first time in a long time. They strolled around the walls of Dukso Palace, holding hands. Wook felt happy with her. If he becomes a professional this time, he will introduce her to her father and ask for permission to marry. Mr. Kwon might forgive him if he becomes a professional. Wook was ready to ask for forgiveness from his father, if necessary, as long as he blessed him for marriage. During the walk, Wook told Inae about his plans. It was time to return home — the last bus was leaving. Wook promised Inae a better walk after the tournament, maybe a trip to Pine Islands. Inae liked the idea, and she couldn't wait to spend the remaining days.

Finally, the tournament for which Wook had been preparing for the last six months arrived. As usual, about three hundred participants gathered.

Wook went through three preliminary rounds with nine clean victories, easily making it to the finals. In the main round, twelve of the strongest players participated, including Dong.

In the finals, there were very strong players. Even armed with new knowledge, Wook could only win four games and lost four as well. Two more games remained, one against Dong, who by then had six wins and two losses. If Dong wins both matches, he undoubtedly becomes a professional. Wook needed to win both matches to advance to the final of the next tournament.

They met, separated by the board. Both maintained outward composure, but their hearts were filled with emotions. Wook got the white stones, and the game began. As events unfolded, each gradually realized how strong they had become during the interrupted friendship. Both entered the ranks of the country's top players.

Upon transitioning to the middle game, Dong made a small mistake. Perhaps he was unsettled by how formidable his friend had become. Wook seized the opportunity to turn this inaccuracy to his advantage. The game approached its end, and Wook's victory became apparent, despite a slight disadvantage. Both, as expected from strong players, correctly evaluated the position. Feeling confident, Wook, for the first time since the start of the game, took his eyes off the board and looked at his opponent. Dong looked pale. Wook felt that the short haircut added a touch of tragedy to Dong's pale face; suddenly, he felt remorse.

Wook knew that a player should not let personal feelings intrude into the game. But before him was Dong, not just an opponent! The result of this game was much more important for Dong than for Wook: if Dong won, he could become a professional. Wook was slow to make a decision. There were still options, and there were several places where Wook could concede a few points to change the outcome. Wook surveyed the board.

"I resign," Dong said decisively, bowing. This surprised and disappointed Wook. Why didn't Dong wait a few more moves?! Wook had already decided to concede victory.

Wook had five wins against four losses, while Dong had six wins against three. Wook had a chance to advance to the final of the next tournament, but Dong's prospect of achieving the title of a professional became uncertain. Sipping coffee in a distant corner, waiting for the last game, Wook noticed Dong approaching him. Dong looked upset.

"I suggest you withdraw from the tournament. You don't deserve to be here."

"What?! What are you talking about, Dong?"

"You were going to give me the victory, weren't you? I read your intention from your face. That's why I immediately resigned. I would never let anyone win like that, Wook. Never. Even if it were my father or son."

Wook felt ashamed. Dong was right. Wook still had a long way to go to become a true warrior. He sincerely apologized to Dong.

They both won their last games. Fortunately for Dong, his competitor, who also had six victories, unexpectedly lost, and Dong became a professional. Wook congratulated Dong wholeheartedly. For the first time as long as he could remember, he saw a broad smile on Dong's face with tears in his eyes.

Wook advanced to the next final with six wins and four losses. This, of course, was better than starting from the first round. Furthermore, Wook learned an important lesson from Dong in this tournament. Looking back, giving the victory to Dong would have simply cost Wook his chances of qualification, without helping Dong in any way; Dong became a professional even without that extra win.

With these thoughts and in good spirits, Wook left the Association building. Suddenly, a stranger in his fifties called out to him.

"Mr. Kwon? Can I talk to you?"

"I've never seen you before..."

"I know. Trust me, I mean no harm. Here's my business card. First International Trading Company. Won Yi Han, President."

Evidently, he owned a small export company. What could this person want from him? Wook was intrigued and followed the man into the nearest teahouse.

Mr. Han introduced himself to Wook as a sponsor for competitive Go, or simply, a high-stakes Go game. Players were hired by sponsors based on commissions. Naturally, sponsors sought out strong players for significant winnings. Qualifying tournaments were often the best places for such "casting." Having been selected for the next tournament, Wook became a "commodity" among sponsors, and the first to approach him was Mr. Han.

The gentlemanly man spoke to Wook with utmost politeness. Wook liked the way Mr. Han conducted the conversation, but he remained vigilant – he had heard about competitive Go and the misconduct of sponsors. Before making a decision, Wook decided to listen first.

"I've never played competitive Go, sir. I'm not sure I'm the one you need."

"Don't worry. With your playing strength, learning won't be difficult. It's not much different from playing in a salon, and I'm sure you have experience there."

Wook had doubts. He didn't want to get involved in a new adventure, but money was needed. He had to survive at least until the next tournament, and asking for help from Bu again was no longer an option.

"What will be the stake? And what commission will I get?"

Wook expressed his interest with business-like questions.

"The stake for the match I propose for you to participate in is about a million. I'll provide you with all the details if you agree to my offer. Your share will be 50% of the winnings. I'll handle all payments, whether victorious or defeated. If you inquire around, you'll see that I offer the highest rates in this business."

Wook was confident that Mr. Han was telling the truth. Based on his own knowledge, he knew that standard rates for players were around 35-40% of the winnings. The rates here were indeed the highest, and Wook found it suspicious.

"I understand your doubts. I engage in competitive Go for both profit and to assist talented players. You can inquire and verify my reputation. I support several players in need. I want to add your name to that list."

Wook decided to trust Mr. Han's word. Reputation could indeed be easily verified, as Mr. Han had suggested. Wook needed a job right now, and a stake of a million was significant – enough to buy two houses in the suburbs.

"All right, sir. I'll give it a try. Please, tell me more about the tournament I'll be participating in."

"Have you heard of the triple method, Mr. Kwon?"

"No, sir. Please call me Wook. I'm still young – 'Mr. Kwon' suits your sons better."

"Very well. Despite your age, you're my business partner. But if you prefer, I'll call you Wook," Mr. Han smiled paternally and continued.

"I'll explain what the triple method is, Mr. Kwon... Wook, because the upcoming match will be just that. In such a match, three teams participate. Three sponsors each contribute equal sums, in our case, half a million each. Two of the participants play a game, and the third waits for their turn. After the match, the waiting player takes the place of the loser. Intermediate winnings are recorded on paper. This continues until one player takes the entire stake or until the time, usually 72 hours, runs out."

"What's the point of such a game? Wouldn't it be simpler to play one-on-one?"

"With this method, one can win more with a smaller stake."

"Seventy-two hours seem too long... Besides, if everyone accumulates an equal number of points, no one wins anything, right?"

"Theoretically, yes. But such cases are rare. Emotions play a significant role here. In most cases, the winner becomes known on the second day, around the fortieth hour."

"What's the stake in each game?"

"Twenty thousand on ten thousand."

"How strong are the other two players?"

Soon you'll find out. For now, only one thing is certain: you might have to give a two or three stone handicap to your opponent, possibly also a first kyu, because you're qualified for the next final. The handicap is part of the agreement with the other sponsors, though pressuring you, a player well-known for your skills, is something I cannot do.

I don't like this. There are many first kyu players I don't know, and I won't be able to give them a two-stone handicap.

I understand. But I believe in you. To be honest, before approaching you, I did some research about you. I know you're a graduate of School K, a rarity in this business. I believe in your advantage over other players; having additional qualities helps. I can't predict when or how, but it will be our advantage during the match. That's one of the reasons why I chose you. Anyway, don't feel pressured to win at all costs. I will unconditionally accept any turn of events. Just try for yourself – that's all I ask.

Listening to the sponsor's assurances, Wook felt reassured.

Have you heard the commandment "Be cautious among enemies"? With the triple method, this principle is especially relevant.
Wook struggled to understand the point. What did it mean?

With the triple method, each player encounters two opponents, one against two. You must remember this very well. For safety, consider everyone except me as enemies as soon as the match begins. For example, don't eat or drink anything offered to you by others, except me. There have been cases where something was mixed into food or drink. Once, two players secretly conspired against the third.
Wook was beginning to grasp the kind of world he was about to enter. How does a conspiracy between two against one work? However, he didn't really want to inquire about such details of dishonest conduct. He vaguely guessed it might involve hints during the game or deception during the scoring.

Please, don't worry about it. I'll do my best to ensure nothing like that happens during this match. And you, on your part, just remember the commandment: "Among enemies, be cautious."

I'll remember that...

There's one more thing, Wook.

Yes?

In the triple method of play, there's a tradition: a woman awaits the free player in the adjacent room.

I don't know about you, but some prefer women to watch opponents' games. If a player with a woman doesn't return in time for the next game, he forfeits his turn. However, in such cases, sponsors say nothing – it's the player's right, how he spends his time while waiting for his turn. I, on my part, will respect your choice, whatever it may be. Participants also have the right to request another woman.
Mr. Han explained this strange custom in a businesslike tone, but Wook was nervous – it was an entirely new world for him. There were still so many things he would be exposed to in the world of money! Mr. Han left, promising to provide all the necessary details soon.

The next day, Wook learned the details of the upcoming match. Wook would have to give both players a two-stone handicap, while the other two would play on equal terms. The names of the participants were unknown. The match was scheduled for this Friday, in three days. Wook was worried about the handicap. The opponents must be strong first kyus, as they accepted such a handicap against a player qualified for the next final. A difficult task lay ahead for Wook. Nevertheless, he decided to seize the bull by the horns. There was no turning back.

Wook's career as a competitive Go player began at the "New Life" hotel. This hotel, located in the suburbs, was not very well-known but clean and respectable. At 3:00 PM, the participants of the three teams gathered at the hotel's cafe. After the usual greetings, information on the rules, and clarification of details, they dispersed until the start of the match scheduled for 8:00 PM. Wook and Mr. Han had lunch together in the hotel's restaurant and stayed there until ten minutes to eight. Mr. Han insisted that one should not arrive at the game too early. Wook, a novice in this business, simply followed his sponsor's advice, although he wasn't privy to the reasons behind it.

In the playing room, converted from a regular hotel room, the other participants awaited them. Wook took a seat on a cushion next to Mr. Han. From the adjacent room, a heavily made-up woman in traditional dress emerged. As tradition dictated, she bowed low and withdrew. She was the woman for the third player, waiting for his turn. Wook felt his composure wavering, but he regained his cool immediately.

Wook surveyed his opponents. The first was a chubby man in his thirties with a mustache. The second was about the same age but thin and wore glasses. No other distinguishing features were notable.

Since both opponents maintained a poker face, Wook decided to call them "Mustache" and "Glasses" for his own reference. Some kind of nicknames for personal use were necessary for Wook to distinguish the opponents in order to establish a familiar strategy for each, as a long 72-hour match lay ahead.

The three players sat around the board to draw lots. Wook, being the strongest, drew a handful of white stones. The remaining two called numbers: Mustache chose "one," and Glasses chose "three." Wook automatically became the second number. He opened his palm and poured stones onto the board, then began counting by threes from a large pile. The player whose chosen number coincided with the remaining number of stones after counting would be the first to rest. Since there were two stones left, it fell to Wook to wait for his turn first. The other players took their seats at the board, preparing to start the first game of the night.

Mr. Han silently asked Wook from his cushion if he wanted to go to the adjacent room, pointing to it with his chin. Wook shook his head and began watching the game. Mr. Han continued to sit with an expressionless face. Wook wasn't foolish enough to miss the perfect opportunity to gauge the opponents' strength for the sake of a cheap thrill.

As expected, both opponents were strong first kyus. Random mistakes in their game told Wook that they were slightly inferior to him, but that didn't diminish their strength and experience. Wook realized that playing against them with a two-stone handicap would be the most challenging battle, and he bit his lip.

Mustache won the first game with two bams. The esteemed sponsors exchanged result records. Glasses, the loser of the game, swept the stones from the board without a hint of emotion, then casually switched places with Wook. He didn't even glance toward the adjacent room. From Glasses' composed behavior, Wook recognized an experienced player.

When Wook started playing with Mustache, the doors opened after a careful knock. A hotel boy brought six glasses of orange juice on a tray. Remembering Mr. Han's warning, Wook decided not to drink the juice placed next to him. However, everyone else, including Mr. Han, gulped down their glasses.

Mustache was strong. He used the two-stone advantage to his favor until the middle of the game. Wook was nervous but patiently waited for his chance. Finally, Mustache made a small mistake—he ignored a key point and played elsewhere. Wook had been waiting for such an opportunity; he immersed himself in contemplation.

Thoroughly studying the position paid off. Mustache's minor error turned into a significant one. The black group came under a fierce attack.

Wook could have thrown all his strength into capturing this group, but wisely and in a timely manner changed tactics, preferring a guaranteed victory to a risky game for a major win. As a result, he won: -23 points and three bans.

Usy swapped places with Glasses; the expressions on both faces remained poker-faced. Usy also paid no attention to the adjacent room. Wook started his second game, now against Glasses. Strange things began to happen. Glasses, who had shown his strength in the first match, suddenly turned into a clumsy bear. He attacked Wook's group without a clear plan, playing like a fourth-fifth kyu. Wook was surprised by these unexpected changes and secured a confident victory with 64 points and seven bans.

Usy, still with a poker face, took Glasses' place. The third round of Wook's game began. To his surprise, Glasses stood up, went to the adjacent room, and disappeared there.

The match had not yet emerged from the fuseki when Wook heard the squeak of a bed in the neighboring room. He knew what that meant. Glasses was with a girl. He must have taken off her beautiful national costume. Concentration was lost. He made attempts to focus his attention on the game, wondering how he could be so foolish and unstable in such a serious match. The others simply ignored the noise in the adjacent room. Wook was ashamed. He was the only one behaving unprofessionally.

Wook lost 26 points and three bans. He deserved this defeat and now cursed himself. Glasses did not return, missing his turn. Wook and Usy started a new match. Wook reminded himself of his foolishness in the previous game; the mistake should not be repeated.

The game was in full swing when there was a knock on the door – it was the servant boy again. He handed a piece of paper to Glasses' sponsor. The sponsor's face became serious. He paused, then addressed the people in the room.

"I apologize. My player has informed me that he is withdrawing from the game."

Silence ensued. This meant that the sponsor and his player were losing everything. The sponsor was angry and upset, but behaved like a businessman. He put the entire necessary amount, half a million won, on the table and left the room. The silence continued.

Breaking the silence, Usy's sponsor spoke.

"So, Mr. Han? I suggest stopping the match; I'm sure the players wouldn't want to continue."

"I have no objections, Mr. Chun. Why don't we now determine the expenses and income?"

— Great idea.

After some time, the money left by the unlucky sponsor was divided between the two of them according to the results of the played matches. Wook and Usy cleared the stones from the board. The match, designed for three long days, ended in just a few hours. Mr. Han went with Wook to the nearest pub and told him his assumptions about what had really happened.

"I think drugs were mixed into the juice. The player realized it when he drank it. He was upset that under the influence of drugs, he could no longer win a single game. That's why he decided to drop out of the game."

"But didn't we all drink, except for me? Why did only he get poisoned?"

"Most likely, we will never know what really happened. Although I suspect that the servant knew what he was doing, as well as someone else. Remember that sponsor, Mr. Chun? I'm ready to bet that he wasn't involved in this. He has been involved in such shady stories before. I'm sure he'll never do something like this to me because he owes me something. But you, unlike me, shouldn't trust anyone, especially someone like him. The player under the influence of drugs probably suspected Chun. That's why he let you win with a big advantage. I still don't understand why he didn't drop out immediately but went to the girl... maybe a need for violence..."

"Why would he suspect Chun? He should have suspected you since I was the only one who didn't drink that juice."

"Even in this kind of business, reputation matters. I am well known as a player with clean hands. In such matters, reputation is usually more important than official channels. You'll understand what that means when you gain more experience in this business. By the way, take this. These are your shares of today's winnings. Thanks for the work."

Mr. Han handed Wook an envelope with 122,500 won, exactly the amount Wook had calculated. He felt happy and satisfied that he remembered the commandment in time and didn't drink the juice. Beware among enemies! But it's best, Wook thought, to stay as far away from such situations as possible.

"Mr. Han, I don't know, excuse me if I say this, but I don't want to participate in the triple method anymore. In the singles, I'll play at any time convenient for you..."

"I understand your feelings. I was going to say the same thing. Let's forget about it forever."

Mr. Han agreed without hesitation. Wook felt much more trust in his sponsor.

EXTREME CAUTION BEHIND ENEMY LINES

If you are planning to raid enemy territory, you must exercise extreme caution because everything there is against the invader. On foreign soil, you can never feel confident, even if the situation is in your favor. This commandment is often overlooked, not only in Go but also in ordinary life.

Ms. Keng no longer worked at "The Lake." Wook was told that she had left for another city in search of work two months ago. He was saddened but at the same time felt relieved - now he could fully focus on Inae.

As promised, Wook took Inae to the Pine Islands. However, unlike the trip with Ms. Keng, they went for just one day. Wook enjoyed just being with Inae. Spending the night together, of course, was wonderful, but there was no need for that. Besides, Wook remembered well the advice of Mr. Park.

There was half a month left until the tournament. Wook had become richer, spending more time with Inae. He played Go with her, took her to movies and restaurants. He was happy, although he missed the monotony of weekdays a little.

One day, Mr. Han invited Wook to lunch, which happened two weeks after their last meeting. Wook was curious whether a new match was planned for him.

In the restaurant, several people sat with the sponsor, peers of Wook. Wook knew that all of them were Go players, as he had seen some of them at the qualifying tournament. Wook was informed that all of them were using Mr. Han's services and was offered a seat among the young players.

"Now that Wook has joined us, allow me to introduce him to you. As some of you already know, he has been selected for the upcoming final. Recently, he became a member of our group. I thought no one would object if we all get acquainted, and that's why this dinner is organized."

"Wook, allow me to introduce you to everyone. Let's start from your left... Sung, Yul, Hak, Yong, Shin, and Yun. Remember Yong? He made it to the final with you. You've probably seen them all as they are regular participants in the qualifying tournaments."

While waiting for the food, let me say something. As you well know, I am your sponsor. But more so, I am your fan. I genuinely want each of you to become a professional one day. Until that moment, I would like to help you in any ways available to me. Although my financial situation allows me to support you only in competitive Go, believe me, I'm trying... What's the matter, Shin? Am I a good politician? Ha-ha-ha! I understand. You want to say - shut up and let us eat? Sorry for the long speech; I'll leave you. Young people don't need the company of old men. By the way, try bankrupting me today because all the expenses are on me! Have a good evening."

An amazing man! Mr. Han left, despite everyone trying to persuade him to stay. Food and drinks were immediately brought in. The introductions began.

Shin and Yul, both 25 years old, were called "Brother Shin" and "Brother Yul." The others were Wook's peers, around 20-21 years old, and they were called by their first names. For everyone, including Wook, the main common topic was the qualifying tournament—whenever mentioned, everyone became serious and interested. They also all loved to share stories about their own sacrifices in baduk. Wook easily fit into their company. As usual, the ability of Go to accelerate friendship manifested itself, making it closer and stronger.

After lunch, Shin suggested continuing the banquet, intending to pay for it. The second round took place in a pub. Yul, another "old man" in the group, proposed the third round. Wook, as a newcomer, insisted on the fourth round being on him.

After the fourth round, everyone was drunk. Shin suggested spending the night at a nearby motel. They became best friends.

Shin was a well-known playboy; he had more girls than he could count. Sung was the hope of his family, engaged in the game since the age of 6, and his mother prayed every night for him to become a pro. Yul, according to his own words, was known in the city as the "terminator" for his invincibility in baduk. Hak lost his club after losing a large sum in baduk due to fraud. Yun devoted himself to Go eight days a week. Yong, having married early, already had a two-year-old child. They were all true Go enthusiasts, "crazy" about Go, and Wook was no exception.

The poet, Nek's friend, defined five merits of the Game in his book. Wook remembered the first one as "reward to have good friends." How true it was! The Game gave him six new friends.

The closest became Yong, Wook's peer. They started meeting frequently, playing, practicing, and drinking together. On the days they drank together, Yong always let Wook stay at his place. A small room was all Yong had for his family of three. All protests from Wook that he would be a burden to his wife were ignored by Yong.

Yong's wife, Sook, was a beautiful and exceptional woman. She always greeted her drunk husband and his friend returning home closer to curfew with a smile. Tea was always hot and tasty. On one of those days, Wook had a chance to talk to her while Yong was sleeping.

"I believe in Divine Will. Everything, including Yong's inability to become a pro, is all His will. I pray to God every day, asking not for what I want, but for the fulfillment of His goals. If it's His will for Yong to become a pro, he will. You know, Wook, I pray for you too."

Her face showed no trace of doubt. Wook felt like he understood why she was so happy in a seemingly challenging situation for herself. Although God seemed in no hurry to favor His devoted followers, she had a little money and friends. Friends! Wook immediately thought of Inae and proposed:

"Don't you want to have lunch with me and my friend? The four of us, or maybe five. We'll have a great time."

Her eyes lit up. Inae and Sook could become close friends. The two-year-old woke up and started crying. The conversation ended there.

Two days later, they met at a barbecue restaurant. The child really liked Inae; she held the baby in her arms throughout the entire lunch. Sook and Inae quickly became friends. They had their "women's secrets," often laughing among themselves, paying no attention to the guys.

Wook and Yong, according to their preliminary plans, apologized after lunch and left the girlfriends and the child alone. They hoped that the girls would become as close as they were. Their plan seemed to work. From that day on, the girls started to hang out, go shopping together, or have lunch somewhere. The child called Inae "Aunt." Wook felt an even closer bond with Inae.

(The seven new friends sat in a tea house after their session at the nearby club. The tournament was five months away, and everyone felt a bit bored. As always, Shin had an idea.

_ How about a trip to Busan for a few days? We can go tomorrow if you like.

The idea appealed to everyone. The beach in Busan was just what they needed for a change of scenery. Shin continued, as if everything was already planned:

— Five thousand won from each of us should be enough. If we run out of money, we know what to do — find a few fish for baduk. It's better to take the train than the bus because you can play Go on the train. The game is the best thing to pass the time, isn't it? Upon arrival, I'll treat each of you to a Busan chicken. Trust my experience; Busan chicks are very uninhibited, influenced by the ocean wind blowing up their skirts.

Soon, everyone was as cheerful as Shin.

— I offer my services for baduk. As you know, I am the most experienced...

— Oh, stop it! Aren't you the guy who lost a Go club playing baduk? I'll play alone. I'll show you why they call me the terminator.

— Better let Sung play. He has such a naive expression — any rookie will fall for it!

It didn't matter who would play; they were all the best players in the country. They knew it. They just wanted to support the fun.

The next morning, the seven Go enthusiasts met on the train to Busan. The five-hour journey seemed short — Shin's lecture on "How to win a girl" made everyone forget about time. They listened to the playboy's detailed story, even forgetting to play Go. The train arrived in Busan during the day.

They were greeted by the calm winter ocean. Yul couldn't wait to start with baduk. Before making any plans, he wanted to replenish the main funds.)

— Maybe we should take it easy today? I'm deadly tired. - Hak said.

It seemed that the journey had a greater impact on Hak than the others, given his fragile physique. Everyone agreed that first they needed to get settled, and what to do next was not that important. Anyway, options were plentiful to enjoy themselves.

After lunch on the promenade – a bit of tasty live fish – they headed to the motel. Hak went to rest, and the rest gathered in a large room. Yul was encouraging those who were reluctant to play baduk.

You know how to find a rookie in a foreign city? What sane person would play a high-stakes baduk game with a guy they've never seen before? You need a reliable search tactic.

— Tell us, Yul. - everyone paid attention.

— Okay. Generally, I don't give this away for free. But for you, please. First, go to the local club and look for someone around 3 kyu. If you find one, just silently observe their game. This is to determine how strong they are. Observe the tendencies in their game, style, weaknesses, etc...

— What handicap will you give to 3-4 kyu?

— Patience, Sung! Everything has its time. You act as if you're trying to seduce a girl without even introducing yourself! Okay, where was I? Yes, observe the game. You just sit and watch until the guy finishes the game, and then you say:

— Sir! You're such a strong player. I'm impressed by your deep understanding of the game! — Don't forget to mention the deep understanding; it inflates his ego. The guy already feels like a pro, and now you jump on him approximately like this:

— But I think there's a mistake here, sir.

Hearing that, the guy will get offended — who dared to insult his move, a player with a deep understanding! He will say something like the following:

What's your rank? — for him, it's a challenge to defend his honor in front of friends at the club. You modestly say:

— Around 1 kyu, not very strong though.

The rookie will slow down a bit, but in nine out of ten cases, he will challenge you for a game like this:

— Sir, I believe you need six stones, not two. — He will jump to the ceiling:

— Six? What the... why are you telling me this? I played with professionals at five stones.

As you know, professionals never play at their full strength with amateurs. They either win with a slight advantage or even let the amateur win. Professionals have no need to win – it's just a tribute to their fans. Rookies, not knowing the whole truth, always object: "I played against a pro... so and so... at five stones and lost only by six points..."

No wonder, all rookies are dreamers. Anyway, hearing this, you should say something like: "We shouldn't play if the handicap is false. Anyway, I only play baduk..."

Then the rookie will continue, saying that with six stones, he's ready to bet his wife or something like that. You just have to politely say:

— Okay, sir. Don't be upset. I've come to these conclusions just by observing your game. If you really want to play baduk, big baduk, you can always find me in the motel across the street. Then you should leave the club. The rest is known. The rookie will run to the motel to give you his money.

Whether Yul's theory would work or not, it demonstrated how experienced Yul was in baduk. He wanted to prove his theory to everyone.

— Hey, Wook! You've played baduk – let's go catch some rookies. No? Too tired? And you, Sung? Come on! Fantastic! Soon Sung and I will be back with the loot!

Yul and Sung left. Now it was Shin's turn.

Yun, let's go for a walk. I promise you a fresh Busan beauty!

They also left for the hunt. Only Wook and Yong remained. Yong lay on the mattress, Wook lay down too. Both were tired. It was incredible how the other guys still had so much energy to seek adventures.

— All wonderful friends. Only Go can gather everyone together like this.

Yong sighed. Wook wanted to change the subject.

— Sok is a beautiful woman, Yong. You're very lucky.

— I know. I'm not worthy of such a girl. She has to endure too many difficulties with me.

— Are you married?

— Not yet. She has never pressured me. But sometimes I feel the need to go there and ask God for...

— Ask for what?
— In Go, you sometimes lose a game that seemed impossible to lose. Analyzing it, you realize that the losing move was the only one – the one you played. You try to figure out how you could choose the dumbest move; it's incomprehensible. But the fact remains: you played like that, and you lost. I'm sure you've had a similar experience, almost everyone has, including professionals. When you analyze this game, you wonder if the outcome of the game is already predetermined by God. And here we are, always trying to win, preparing, practicing, meditating... I feel like a fool thinking about it. Maybe the outcome of life, like the result of a game, is already predetermined.

Wook agreed with him. The thought of life's predestination troubled Wook a lot. What fate awaits him, what will happen? Yong snored. A minute later, Wook followed his example.

They were awakened by the returning Shin and Yun. It was almost midnight.

— Lost! They got away! All because of you, Yun. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Shin spoke loudly and seemed cheerful. Yun was silent and looked upset.

— We successfully ambushed two chicks. I even managed to wait for their phrase: "Oh, we're so tired!" to lead them somewhere. But before I could open my mouth, Yun intervened in the conversation and said, "Why not let them go home? They're tired." Ha-ha-ha! Hearing that, the girls decided that we were rejecting them, and instantly flew away like furious furies. Yun, you still have a lot to learn!

Shin, it seemed, was not upset. Loud footsteps were heard outside the door – Yun and Sung were returning.

— Got one local guy! He'll be here soon. I need a room. Give me all the money you have. The kid says he won't play until he sees the money.

— Yun, are you sure it's the right one? What's his rank?

— Don't worry, Shin. Maximum 3 kyu, more likely 4-5 kyu. I could have given him nine stones. Just in case, I offered seven, and this rookie almost lost consciousness. He says no one gave him more than three stones. God bless these rookies with their illusions! Let's see. This is all you have, Yun? Don't take it to heart. Yes, it will be enough. Until morning!

Yun and Sung hurriedly left. The remaining four decided to go to sleep. All that was left for them was to wait for Yun to return, hopefully enriched. They would then just pat him on the back for a job well done. So far, things were going well.

Юл and Sung returned at dawn, around four in the morning. They did not look like triumphants or wealthy men at all.

What happened, Yun? Didn't you say it would be easy?!
— We lost all the money. But not in bannegi...

— What?! Did you play poker?

No, we just got caught in a trap by local thugs, I think.
— Tell us!

At first, we played bannegi. As expected, I was winning easily – there was no one to compete with. Then one of the opponent's buddies, who was watching the game, left. We thought – let's wash up or something. He came back with four guys. They said they were from the police and came to arrest us. They ordered Sung and me to follow them. I knew they weren't from the police: if we had gone out, they would have just beaten us, if not worse. I considered it better to give them the money right away – they would have taken the money anyway. They didn't touch us and just left with the money... I'm really sorry, guys, it turned out like this. My stupidity – I didn't think about the details... As soon as we get back to Seoul, I'll give back all the money...
Yong jumped up:

— Well, well, brother Yun! What a good opinion you have of us. Would you have kept all the winnings for yourself if everything had gone smoothly? It's not your fault – these things happen. I'm sure there's no one here who would want to get their money back!

— Thanks, Yong. I just feel so bad...

— Hey, Yun, don't take it to heart. Consider yourselves lucky that they didn't harm you. Look at Sung – he's still shaking, ha-ha-ha. If you think about it, we're not any better – didn't we plan to take all the money ourselves?

Shin, as always, didn't dwell on misfortune. But there was nothing to be particularly happy about. The money was gone, friends began to count the remaining amounts. They were lucky that Hak was not involved in the events, peacefully sleeping in his room. They woke him up; fortunately, the amount left with Hak was enough for the return trip to Seoul.

The journey, promising to be fun and interesting, ended prematurely. The beach and the girls Shin promised would have to wait. The guys quietly drank soju all the way back home.

Although they were not the best players in the country, they forgot such an obvious thing: extreme caution behind enemy lines. Although the journey couldn't be considered a failure – thanks to this trip, their friendship strengthened.

BYOYOMI

In Ssul, shocking news awaited them. In the official game, there is time control for each participant. A player who exhausts their entire time automatically incurs defeat. However, there is a buffer period that adds some flexibility to this rule.

When the time control is down to 10 minutes, a second countdown called "byo-yomi" begins. If a player makes a move within one minute, that time is not counted in "byo-yomi." If more than a minute is taken for a move, that time is subtracted from the remaining 10 minutes.

Since it's not very convenient for the player to keep track of the time, a referee-chronometrist is used. The chronometrist counts seconds aloud and warns the player about the remaining time. It goes like this:

"Mr. X, you have 10 minutes left. Starting the countdown. 15... 30... 40... 50... the last 10 seconds, 1; 2...9, 10. You used one minute. Now, you have 9 minutes left..."

The last 10 seconds of each minute are pronounced one by one. The critical moment comes when the player has used up 9 out of 10 minutes, and only one minute remains. In this case, if the chronometrist says "leesang" at the end of the minute, the player is considered to have exceeded the time, and they are credited with a loss. People who have experienced the countdown, especially during the last minute, unanimously claim that their blood ran cold.

The Board of Directors of the Korean Go Association selected a new president. The new president was an energetic businessman, the head of a major conglomerate. His ambitions and love for Go resulted in several important changes. Initially, he planned to sponsor existing professionals so that they would be free from financial worries. This way, professionals could concentrate their efforts on the game. There were cases where excellent players had to quit the game due to financial difficulties. This plan was undoubtedly a necessary and positive change, significantly improving the socio-economic status of professional players.

The new president had other plans as well. He wanted to change the procedure for selecting professionals, intending to limit the age of candidates to 18 years. The new pros should start their training at an early age.

Of course, the tradition of conducting qualification tournaments should become a thing of the past. This will put an end to the "stubborn eccentrics," "tough nuts," "madmen," and "abnormals" in their pursuit of a dream. The changes were planned to be implemented within a year.

From a distant perspective, the changes were useful, if not ideal. However, for people like Wook, it was a heavy blow. The qualification tournament would be held two more times, and only four players would become professionals.

The situation resembled the countdown in the last minute. Those who do not become professionals within these two tournaments will have to look for something else.

Yun declared that he would continue playing Go even after the cancellation of qualification tournaments. He believed that his efforts would be rewarded, even though they might seem reckless.

Yul wanted to return to his city and play Baduk to make a living. He was very sad when boasting that there were as many novices in the city as autumn leaves.

Yong was preparing to work on a construction site – he needed to think about his family.

Hak planned to return to the village to borrow money from his parents and open a Go club. He added that his parents would have to sell everything they have.

Shin, as always, was unique. He would go to Taiwan, where there is no distinction between amateurs and professionals. According to him, he could become a professional by winning three times at championships. After becoming a professional in Taiwan, he would return home and demand recognition from the Association. He understood the tension of such a plan and was not as cheerful as usual, even when talking about Taiwanese girls.

Sung was more worried about his parents than himself. He added that they might end their lives in suicide.

Wook was deeply upset. He physically felt the triumphal voice of his father saying, "Didn't I tell you?" The last two tournaments, the last two chances. Wook was obliged to become a professional for Ina, for Mr. Park, Mrs. Cheng, Mrs. Kang, and the landlady. What if he couldn't make it?

To Wook and his friends, the tough nuts, life was particularly unfair. But despite everything, they couldn't sit and complain because "byo-yomi" had begun. The player must play, and they continued to prepare for the two remaining tournaments.

CURRENT WATER DOES NOT COMPETE FOR FIRST PLACE

These words, first spoken by a Chinese scholar, were often quoted by Takagawa 9-dan, the honorary Honinbo. Current water signifies the natural course of life. Going against the flow is fraught with peril.

Wook once again turned his attention to Takagawa's games, which he had ignored. Master Wu's games showed him balance and dynamics. Master Takagawa's games were an excellent example of how a series of ordinary and simple moves could turn out to be brilliant masterful play. With his games, the Master emphasized the importance of truth in simplicity.

The calm moves of Master Takagawa somehow helped heal Wook's wounds caused by the looming threat of tournament cancellations. The penultimate tournament was starting in a week:

In the spring tournament, as expected, the competition was very tough. Only Shin managed to advance through the preliminary rounds to join Wook and Yong in the finals. With 4 wins and 4 losses each, both Wook and Yong were no longer contenders for the professional title. Two more rounds remained on the next day. However, Shin had secured seven victories with 1 loss. If he could win at least one of the remaining two games, he would become a professional. One of his games would be against Ho, his old friend, who had five wins and three losses. Ho still had a slim chance of becoming a professional if he won both games the next day.

The tournament participants went out for a drink. Ho was also with them. Many hoped that Ho would graciously concede victory to Shin. Speaking openly about it was not customary; Ho had to decide for himself. After everyone emptied a few cups of soju, Ho slowly said, addressing Shin:

Congratulations, Shin, 1-dan.

— What did you say, Ho? — Shin was in shock.

Do you really think I will try to beat you tomorrow? If you win, the title is guaranteed for you. My chances are slim even with two wins, and I need a fortunate outcome. For that, you'll have to keep pouring drinks for me until I stop you or slap you. Got it?

Shin cried. For the first time in his life, Wook saw Shin cry. Shin knew too well how difficult it was for Ho to let go of this hope, however faint it might be, especially after the disappointing results in the previous tournament. He couldn't hold back the tears.

Wook forgot about his insignificant results and rejoiced for Shin. Before him was an example of excellent friendship. Wook thought, "Current water does not compete for first place." Friendship is like current water; it never goes against the laws of life.

FIVE-PETAL FLOWER

There is a form resembling a five-petal flower. It is advisable to avoid this form as it harbors danger within itself. Even when captured, this poisonous form can kill the captor.

There is another form with the same name, although it does not resemble a flower. This second form is encountered more frequently and is the cause of the demise of many groups.

Among humans, there are also poisonous and deadly five-petal flowers. Ho's wife was such a five-petal flower. Ho returned home in a good mood.

This time, Shin did it. Now he is a professional. Isn't it great? You were rooting for him, right?

— What happened? Why do you look like that?

— You only pretend to care for others.

What?! You don't like that I helped Shin? Stop it! I couldn't have acted differently. One win guarantees him the title, and even two of my wins only offer a slim chance.
_ Why give up when there's even a slight chance?

This is called friendship. Please try to understand. We'll talk about it later. It's already past midnight. Time to sleep. I promise I'll do it next time.

— Listen. As long as we've been married, I can't buy myself anything I want... all because of this cursed game. I patiently waited for you to become a professional because it would mean the end of our poverty. Now you claim that you've trampled my hope just like that, all because of Shin?

I want you to choose between me and Shin. If you choose Shin, you'll never see me and your child. It's either him or me!

You're pushing me into the mud!
— Him or me?

— Why are you going to extremes? It's not about you or him!

— Him or me?

— Be reasonable!

— Me or him?

_ Do you want me to answer right now?

— Me or him?

— I should choose you, my dear...

— Call him right now and tell him you've changed your mind.

— Why now?

— So you can't lie tomorrow when you let him win. You would say you tried but lost. I'm dialing his number.

Shin answered the phone.

— Shin? It's Ho. I'm calling... to say... I can't give you the victory tomorrow, sorry.

What? What made you change your mind?
I thought, and... my wife said.

Shin hung up, upset and angry. It happened, what he feared. Again, Ho's wife, the five-petal flower. Now Shin had no choice. He bit his lips, determined to do everything in his power. Ho was also contemplating the situation now. He had no choice but to try to defeat Shin.

The next day, they played according to the schedule. Shin was trembling with anger. In a calm state, they had equal chances. But in such an emotional state, Shin couldn't break Ho, lost to Shin, and the next game. After two wins, Ho caught up with Shin - both had 7 wins and 3 losses.

A young participant named Choi, winning all ten games, became the first candidate to be awarded the title of a professional. Teenagers, with everything ahead of them and who could become professionals in the next few years, still took part in this penultimate championship. One of them quickly occupied the vacant place, as did Choi.

The remaining spot had to be contested among three players who had 7 wins and 3 losses each. The three were Shin, Ho, and Chan, the participant from the youth championship. Even in the draw, fate favored the junior: he got the right to play with the winner of the game between the competitors. Shin and Ho faced a fateful game. Shin won against Ho.

— Listen to me carefully, Ho. If we play now, the winner will give hope to the child. Since I'm tired of the game and giving up the victory to you, so you will have the best chances. You betrayed me today, but as a friend, I'm giving you this opportunity with one condition: you must win! If you lose, you will become a man who ruined his friend's future for nothing. That's why, as soon as you lose, our friendship will end. Go and win. I really want that.

Shin announced his withdrawal from the tournament. Ho had to fight for the remaining spot to become a professional. Ho lost the game. Along with the defeat, he lost an old friend. When everyone dispersed, Ho remained alone in the room for about two hours, staring at the ceiling.

DAMEJUMARI

If both white and black groups surround each other, and neither of them has two eyes, excluding seki, one of the groups will die. In such a situation, both sides fill in their opponent's external dame. This process is called seimeai.

During seimeai, you should not fill in your own dame, as it could lead to the death of your own group. In real games, suffocating moves often happen, usually unintentionally by the player.

Time passed, six months flashed by. In a week, the last qualifying tournament was scheduled.

As the championship approached, Wook was losing self-control. After all, this was the most important tournament of his life; there would be no more qualifications. If he missed the chance this time, he would never become a professional. He had to do it! Sometimes even the Go club signs scared him. His fate would be decided in a week.

Wook took Inae to Pine Island for three days. Before the tournament, he wanted to be alone with her. Wook had already decided that if he failed, he would never see her again. Although Inae was unaware of his decision.

On the first day, they simply sat on the shore together, watching the ocean. After dinner, they returned to their room. They lay together, looking out the window at the quiet October ocean, awaiting the arrival of the night. When it got dark, Wook pulled the curtains and hugged her. Just a tight embrace, and that was it. He did nothing more. Soon Inae understood him—he didn't want to waste himself before the tournament. They embraced tightly and soon fell asleep, still in their clothes.

The second day passed, just like the first. At night, Wook talked a lot, holding her.

"Many have cried because of the game. But still, it receives undeserved love from many. It's a mysterious thing. I want to become a pro. That's true. After all this, as a victor, I'll take you as my wife.

I'll only be able to explain myself after becoming a pro—with your father, my father, my brother. If I don't do this, I'll have to start everything over. It seems like an unsolvable task, but it's a necessity."

If I don't do this, I'll never see you again. Believe me, it's not because of you but because of myself. I won't be able to date anyone as a loser, especially after boldly choosing my own path against almost everyone's will.

Do you remember that day at your house? I said that Abraham is just an abstract concept, and everything could be Abraham. I, against my own theory, made Go my Abraham. Am I not a fool?!

His words were not carefully thought out. He just spoke, almost feverishly. Maybe he wanted to hear her protest. What did winning at Go have to do with their marriage?

But Inae didn't object. She just listened and quietly cried.

The final tournament arrived. Rumor had it that Ho had parted ways with the five-petal flower and became a Buddhist monk. There were also rumors that his wife had also entered a monastery. No one had seen Shin.

Wook approached the final with an excellent record of 9 victories. Yong and Sung also made it to the final. Yun, Hak, and Yul were eliminated in the third round. Their fate was decided several days before Wook, Yong, and Sung. Eleven players were selected for the final. There is no more qualification tournament after the next one, so only the top two will matter.

After two days of play, the contours of the final standings began to emerge. Youthful Kil won 9 games and secured the first place. Sung lost 4 games in a row and lost all hope. Wook and Yong had the same number of points before the last game: 7 wins and 2 losses. The next competitor had only 6 wins and 3 losses. Ironically, Wook and Yong faced each other in the decisive match. The winner would become a professional, the loser would never become one.

The game began. Wook felt lucky with the draw – he played as black even after giving komi. Friends and rivals faced off. Neither of them would give the other a chance. The game progressed, and both gradually calmed down. They both wanted to play a good game, regardless of the outcome.

All other games were insignificant. Other participants, quickly finishing their games, gathered around the most important match. Dong was also in the crowd. In the middle of the game, Yong made a mistake, incorrectly evaluating the position. Wook seized the opportunity and gained an advantage. Yong fought desperately, but the gap kept widening. The only chance left for Yong was in the lower right corner against Wook. Wook rechecked all the variations and confirmed that there was nothing for the opponent to do in that corner.

Yong continued to stare at that corner, intending to play there. A high-ranking player in a losing position often makes a futile move and, after the opponent's correct response, resigns. Yong, intensely studying the corner, must have identified a place for resignation after Wook's correct answer. The time he took was necessary to come to terms with the defeat that meant so much.

Both players had already used all their time and were in overtime. But it no longer mattered because the game, essentially, was over.

For the first time since the beginning of the game, Wook looked away from the board and was startled: in the corner where no one was, there was Sok. She was praying with folded hands. But God could do nothing for Yong. Not even the ghost of Jyva could help. It was clear that the game was good, and it was just as clear that it was over.

Yong finally played in the corner, listening to the timekeeper counting seconds. Nothing could be done. Both Yong and Wook knew it. People following the game knew it too. Yong was about to resign after Wook's next move.

8, 9, 10. You have only one minute left!

The judge raised his voice slightly to get Wook's attention. This move would cut off Yong's head, Wook thought. Just like Sok's head and the child's.

— 30 seconds...

Wook lifted the stone. He hesitated.

— 50 seconds, 1,2,3...

Wook held the stone in his hand.

— 4, 5, 6...

He moved his hand.

— 7, 8, 9...

The timekeeper said "ten," and Wook still held the stone in his hand. Wook lost on time.

— What?!

Yong shouted. He couldn't believe his eyes or ears. No sound came from the stunned crowd. Wook slowly stood up, bowed to Yong, gently patted him on the back, and left, leaving the crowd in shock.

No one ever saw Wook again.
